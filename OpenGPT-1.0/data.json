    "Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced",
    "After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\"",
    "The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people",
    "Edit warringWikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\"",

    "In addition to the terms, the Foundation has developed policies, described as the \"official policies of the Wikimedia Foundation\"",
    "The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the \"Five pillars\", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content",
    "The five pillars are:Wikipedia is an encyclopediaWikipedia is written from a neutral point of viewWikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distributeWikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civilityWikipedia has no firm rulesThe rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus",
    "Editors can enforce the rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material",
    "Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia",
    "They have since diverged to some extent",
    "The two most commonly used namespaces across all editions of Wikipedia are: The article namespace (which are the articles of the encyclopedia) and the category namespace (which are a collection of pages such as articles)",
    "In addition, there have been various books and reading list that are composed completely of articles and categories of a certain Wikipedia",
    "Content policies and guidelinesAccording to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style",
    "A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of \"notability\", which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject",
    "Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized",
    "It must not present original research",
    "A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations",
    "Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \"verifiability, not truth\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations",

    "In particular, editors can choose to run for \"adminship\", which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes",
    "Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits",
    "Dispute resolutionOver time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process",
    "To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\"",
    "Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field",
    "Joseph Reagle and Sue Gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by Quakers",
    "A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings",
    "Arbitration CommitteeMain article: Arbitration Committee (Wikipedia)The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process",
    "Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted",
    "Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate",
    "Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased)",
    "Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior",

    "Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\"",
    "Editors who do not log in are in some sense \"second-class citizens\" on Wikipedia, as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\", but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty",

    "Free content, libre content, libre information, or free information, is any kind of functional work, work of art, or other creative content that meets the definition of a free cultural work, meaning \"works or expressions which can be freely studied, applied, copied and/or modified, by anyone, for any purpose",
    "\"DefinitionLogo of the Definition of Free Cultural Works projectA free cultural work is, according to the definition of Free Cultural Works, one that has no significant legal restriction on people's freedom to:use the content and benefit from using it,study the content and apply what is learned,make and distribute copies of the content,change and improve the content and distribute these derivative works",
    "Free content encompasses all works in the public domain and also those copyrighted works whose licenses honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above",
    "Because the Berne Convention in most countries by default grants copyright holders monopolistic control over their creations, copyright content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work",
    "Although there are a great many different definitions in regular everyday use, free content is legally very similar, if not like an identical twin, to open content",
    "An analogy is a use of the rival terms free software and open-source, which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones",
    "For instance, the Open Knowledge Foundation's Open Definition describes \"open\" as synonymous to the definition of free in the \"Definition of Free Cultural Works\" (as also in the Open Source Definition and Free Software Definition)",
    "For such free/open content both movements recommend the same three Creative Commons licensesLegal mattersCopyrightMain article: CopyrightCopyright symbolCopyright is a legal concept, which gives the author or creator of a work legal control over the duplication and public performance of their work",
    "In many jurisdictions, this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the public domain",
    "Copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works",
    "During the time period of copyright the author's work may only be copied, modified, or publicly performed with the consent of the author, unless the use is a fair use",
    "Traditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the author's content or limit their use to fair use",
    "Secondly, it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found",
    "Finally, it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, such as mashups and collaborative content",
    "Public domainMain article: Public domainPublic domain logoThe public domain is a range of creative works whose copyright has expired or was never established, as well as ideas and facts which are ineligible for copyright",
    "A public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public or no longer can claim control over, the distribution and usage of the work",
    "As such, any person may manipulate, distribute, or otherwise use the work, without legal ramifications",
    "A work in the public domain or released under a permissive license may be referred to as \"copycenter\"",
    "CopyleftMain article: CopyleftCopyleft symbolCopyleft is a play on the word copyright and describes the practice of using copyright law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified versions of a work",
    "The aim of copyleft is to use the legal framework of copyright to enable non-author parties to be able to reuse and, in many licensing schemes, modify content that is created by an author",
    "Unlike works in the public domain, the author still maintains copyright over the material, however, the author has granted a non-exclusive license to any person to distribute, and often modify, the work",
    "Copyleft licenses require that any derivative works be distributed under the same terms and that the original copyright notices be maintained",
    "A symbol commonly associated with copyleft is a reversal of the copyright symbol, facing the other way; the opening of the C points left rather than right",
    "Unlike the copyright symbol, the copyleft symbol does not have a codified meaning",
    "UsageProjects that provide free content exist in several areas of interest, such as software, academic literature, general literature, music, images, video, and engineering",
    "Technology has reduced the cost of publication and reduced the entry barrier sufficiently to allow for the production of widely disseminated materials by individuals or small groups",
    "Projects to provide free literature and multimedia content have become increasingly prominent owing to the ease of dissemination of materials that are associated with the development of computer technology",
    "Such dissemination may have been too costly prior to these technological developments",
    "MediaCreative Commons logoIn media, which includes textual, audio, and visual content, free licensing schemes such as some of the licenses made by Creative Commons Repositories exist which exclusively feature free material and provide content such as photographs, clip art, music, and literature",
    "While extensive reuse of free content from one website in another website is legal, it is usually not sensible because of the duplicate content problem",
    "Wikipedia is amongst the most well-known databases of user-uploaded free content on the web",
    "While the vast majority of content on Wikipedia is free content, some copyrighted material is hosted under fair-use criteria",
    "SoftwareMain article: Free and open-source softwareOSI logoFree Software Foundation logoFree and open-source software, which is also often referred to as open source software and free software, is a maturing technology with major companies using free software to provide both services and technology to both end-users and technical consumers",
    "The ease of dissemination has allowed for increased modularity, which allows for smaller groups to contribute to projects as well as simplifying collaboration",
    "Open source development models have been classified as having a similar peer-recognition and collaborative benefit incentives that are typified by more classical fields such as scientific research, with the social structures that result from this incentive model decreasing production cost",
    "Given sufficient interest in a software component, by using peer-to-peer distribution methods, distribution costs of software may be reduced, removing the burden of infrastructure maintenance from developers",
    "As distribution resources are simultaneously provided by consumers, these software distribution models are scalable, that is the method is feasible regardless of the number of consumers",
    "In some cases, free software vendors may use peer-to-peer technology as a method of dissemination",
    "In general, project hosting and code distribution is not a problem for the most of free projects as a number of providers offer them these services free",
    "Engineering and technologyMain articles: Open-source hardware and Open-design movementLogo of the Open Source Hardware AssociationFree content principles have been translated into fields such as engineering, where designs and engineering knowledge can be readily shared and duplicated, in order to reduce overheads associated with project development",
    "Open design principles can be applied in engineering and technological applications, with projects in mobile telephony, small-scale manufacture, the automotive industry, and even agricultural areas",
    "Technologies such as distributed manufacturing can allow computer-aided manufacturing and computer-aided design techniques to be able to develop small-scale production of components for the development of new, or repair of existing, devices",
    "Rapid fabrication technologies underpin these developments, which allow end-users of technology to be able to construct devices from pre-existing blueprints, using software and manufacturing hardware to convert information into physical objects",
    "AcademiaMain article: Open accessIn academic work, the majority of works are not free, although the percentage of works that are open access is growing rapidly",
    "Open access refers to online research outputs that are free of all restrictions on access (e",

    "certain copyright and license restrictions)",
    "Authors may see open access publishing as a method of expanding the audience that is able to access their work to allow for greater impact of the publication, or may support it for ideological reasons",
    "Open access publishers such as PLOS and BioMed Central provide capacity for review and publishing of free works; though such publications are currently more common in science than humanities",
    "Various funding institutions and governing research bodies have mandated that academics must produce their works to be open-access, in order to qualify for funding, such as the US National Institutes of Health, Research Councils UKEuropean Union At an institutional level some universities, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have adopted open access publishing by default by introducing their own mandates",
    "Some mandates may permit delayed publication and may charge researchers for open access publishing",
    "Open content publication has been seen as a method of reducing costs associated with information retrieval in research, as universities typically pay to subscribe for access to content that is published through traditional means whilst improving journal quality by discouraging the submission of research articles of reduced quality",
    "Subscriptions for non-free content journals may be expensive for universities to purchase, though the article are written and peer-reviewed by academics themselves at no cost to the publisher",
    "This has led to disputes between publishers and some universities over subscription costs, such as the one which occurred between the",
    "For teaching purposes, some universities, including MIT, provide freely available course content, such as lecture notes, video resources and tutorials",
    "This content is distributed via Internet resources to the general public",
    "Publication of such resources may be either by a formal institution-wide program, or alternately via informal content provided by individual academics or departments",
    "LegislationAny country has its own law and legal system, sustained by its legislation, a set of law-documents\u2014documents containing statutory obligation rules, usually law and created by legislatures",
    "In a democratic country, each law-document is published as open media content, is in principle free content; but in general, there are no explicit licenses attributed for each law-document, so the license must be interpreted, an implied license",
    "Only a few countries have explicit licenses in their law-documents, as the UK's Open Government Licence (a CC BY compatible license)",

    "Open contentThe logo on the screen in the subject's left hand is a Creative Commons license, while the paper in his right hand explains, in Khmer, that the image is open content",
    "Open content describes any work that others can copy or modify freely by attributing to the original creator, but without needing to ask for permission",

    "The openness Unlike free content and content under open-source licenses, there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'",

    "OKF gave an Open Knowledge Definition for \"content such as music, films, books; data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise; government and other administrative information\"",
    "Open Works and Open Licenses were defined and \"open\" is described as synonymous to the definitions of open/free in the Open Source Definition, the Free Software Definition and the Definition of Free Cultural Works",

    "TextbooksMain article: Open textbookThe textbook industry is one of the educational industries in which open content can make the biggest impact",
    "Traditional textbooks, aside from being expensive, can also be inconvenient and out of date, because of publishers' tendency to constantly print new editions",
    "Open textbooks help to eliminate this problem, because they are online and thus easily updatable",
    "Being openly licensed and online can be helpful to teachers, because it allows the textbook to be modified according to the teacher's unique curriculum",

    "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannicalibrary",
    "Title page of Lucubrationesencyclopedia in the titleAn encyclopedia (American English) or encyclop\u00e6dia (British English) is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general or special to a particular field or discipline",
    "Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are arranged alphabetically by article name or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and searchable",
    "Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries",
    "Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title; this is unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms",
    "The appearance of digital and open-source versionsWikipedia, has vastly expanded the accessibility, authorship, readership, and variety of encyclopedia entries",
    "EtymologyIndeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race in the future years to come",
    "DiderotThe word encyclopedia (encyclo|pedia) comes from the Koine Greek \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, transliterated enkyklios paideia, meaning 'general education' from enkyklios (\u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), meaning 'circular, recurrent, required regularly, general' and paideia (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1), meaning 'education, rearing of a child'; together, the phrase literally translates as 'complete instruction' or 'complete knowledge'",
    "However, the two separate words were reduced to a single word due to a scribal error by copyists of a Latin manuscript edition of Quintillian The copyists took this phrase to be a single Greek word, enkyklopaedia, with the same meaning, and this spurious Greek word became the Neo-Latin word encyclopaedia, which in turn came into English",
    "Because of this compounded word, fifteenth-century readers and since have often, and incorrectly, thought that the Roman authors Quintillian and Pliny described an ancient genre",
    "CharacteristicsThis section possibly contains original research",
    "Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding",
    "Statements consisting only of original research should be removed",
    "() (Learn how and when to remove this template message)The modern encyclopedia evolved from the dictionary Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been compiled by well-educated, well-informed content experts, but they are significantly different in structure",
    "A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of words and their definitions",
    "Synonymous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment",
    "Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited information, analysis or background for the word defined",
    "While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in understanding the meaning, significance or limitations of a term, and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge",
    "To address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a subject or discipline",
    "In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject",
    "An encyclopedia article also often includes many maps and illustrations, as well as bibliography and statistics",
    "An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity",
    "Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has said that the goal of an encyclopedia should be to provide \"the sum of all human knowledge, but sum meaning summary",
    "\"In addition, sometimes books or reading lists are compiled from a compendium of articles (either wholly or partially taken) from a specific encyclopedia",
    "Four major elementsThere are four major elements that define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and German Brockhaus are well-known examples)",
    "General encyclopedias may contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and gazetteers",
    "[citation needed] There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the Great Soviet Encyclopedia or Encyclopaedia Judaica",
    "Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of medicine, philosophy or law",
    "Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the target audience",
    "Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable for reference",
    "There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the alphabetical method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by hierarchical categories",
    "The former method is today the more common, especially for general works",
    "The fluidity of electronic media, however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content",
    "Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, indexing and cross reference",
    "The epigraph from HoraceEncyclop\u00e9die suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: \"What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection",
    "\"As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, new methods have emerged for the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds",
    "Projects such as , Encarta, , and Wikipedia are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as information retrieval becomes simpler",
    "The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts, such was the case of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia mentioned above which was entirely state sponsored, while the Britannica was supported as a for-profit institution",
    "Encyclopedic dictionariesSome works entitled \"dictionaries\" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the Dictionary of the Middle Ages, the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, and Black's Law Dictionary)",
    "The Macquarie Dictionary, Australia's national dictionary, became an encyclopedic dictionary after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns",
    "Differences between encyclopedias and dictionariesThere are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries",
    "Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries",
    "There are differences in content as well",
    "Generally speaking, dictionaries provide linguistic information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the things for which those words stand",
    "Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name",
    "As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be",
    "In practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, \"encyclopedic\" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries",
    "Thus encyclopedias may contain material that is also found in dictionaries, and vice versa",
    "In particular, dictionary entries often contain factual information about the thing named by the word",

    "Financial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias",

    "Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster",
    "Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias",
    "Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws",

    "Modern English is both the most spoken language in the world and the third-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish",
    "It is also the most widely learned second language in the world, with more second-language speakers than native speakers",
    "English is either the official language or one of the official languages in  (such as in India, Ireland, and Canada)",
    "In some other countries, it is the sole or dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law (such as in the United States or United Kingdom)",
    "It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union, and many other international and regional organisations",
    "It has also become the de facto language of diplomacy, science, international trade, tourism, aviation, entertainment and the internet",
    "Old English emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the Anglo-Saxons",
    "Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse, a North Germanic language",
    "Then, Middle English borrowed words extensively from French dialects, which make up about  of Modern English words, and from Latin, which also provides about",
    "Thus, although most of its vocabulary now comes from Romance languages, its grammar, phonology, and most commonly-used words keep it genealogically classified under the Germanic branch",

    "YiddishA family tree of the West Germanic language familyEnglish is an Indo-European language and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages",
    "Old English originated from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the Frisian North Sea coast, whose languages gradually evolved into the Anglic languages in the British Isles, and into the Frisian languages and Low German/Low Saxon on the continent",
    "The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the Anglo-Frisian languages, are the closest living relatives of English",
    "Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic) languages, though this grouping remains debated",
    "Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English",
    "Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including Scots and the extinct Fingallian dialect and Yola language of Ireland",
    "Like Icelandic and Faroese, the development of English in the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and it has since diverged considerably",
    "English is not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some of these, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages",
    "Unlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly Old Norse and Norman French",
    "These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic clades\u2014but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either",
    "Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole\u2014a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis",
    "Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language",
    "English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares innovations with other Germanic languages such as Dutch, German, and Swedish",
    "These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called Proto-Germanic",
    "Some shared features of Germanic languages include the division of verbs into strong and weak classes, the use of modal verbs, and the sound changes affecting Proto-Indo-European consonants, known as Grimm's and Verner's laws",

    "Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of England by William the ConquerorWith the Norman Conquest of EnglandOld French, in particular Old Norman French",
    "Old Norman French in England eventually developed into Anglo-Norman",
    "Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking English, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains",
    "Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar",
    "The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession",
    "The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms, and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible",

    "It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system",
    "Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs",
    "For example, the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today",
    "The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages",

    "Kachru based his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country",
    "The three circles change membership over time",
    "Countries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English",
    "The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the United States the United Kingdom Canada Australia South Africa IrelandNew Zealand In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces",
    "The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world",
    "Estimates of the numbers of second language Linguist David Crystal In Kachru's three-circles model, the \"outer circle\" countries are countries such as the Philippines, Jamaica, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia and Nigeria with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government",
    "Those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole to a more standard version of English",
    "They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction",
    "Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners",
    "Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries, and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well",

    "In both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable, like /t t\u0283 f/, but not before lenis consonants like /d d\u0292 v/ or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of rich [r\u026at\u0283], neat [nit], and safe [se\u026a\u032ff] are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge [r\u026a\u02d1d\u0292], need [ni\u02d1d], and save [se\u02d1\u026a\u032fv], and the vowel of light [la\u026a\u032ft] is shorter than that of lie [la\u02d1\u026a\u032f]",

    "Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not",
    "Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence",
    "Stress in English is phonemic, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress",
    "For instance, the word contract is stressed on the first syllable (/\u02c8k\u0252ntr\u00e6kt/ KON-trakt) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable (/k\u0259n\u02c8tr\u00e6kt/ k\u0259n-TRAKT) for most meanings (for example, \"reduce in size\") when used as a verb",
    "Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun \"contract\" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel /\u0252/, but in the verb \"contract\" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to /\u0259/",

    "Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English",
    "They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs",
    "For example, in the phrase I gave it to him, the preposition to marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb to give",
    "Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, \"with her\", \"to me\", \"for us\"",

    "Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms",
    "They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods",
    "Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence",
    "Most verbs have six inflectional forms",
    "The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form",
    "The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle",
    "The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject",

    "For the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should",

    "An infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause",
    "Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form",
    "In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause",
    "For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is see, which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive",
    "Phrasal verbsEnglish also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb",
    "The phrase then functions as a single predicate",
    "In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word",
    "Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc",
    "The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e",
    "lay off meaning terminate someone's employment)",
    "In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent",
    "AdverbsMain article: English adverbsThe function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs",
    "Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix -ly",

    "Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good, which has the adverbial form well",
    "SyntaxIn the English sentence The cat sat on the mat, the subject is the cat (a noun phrase), the verb is \"sat\", and \"on the mat\" is a prepositional phrase composed of a noun phrase \"the mat\", headed by the preposition \"on\"",
    "Modern English syntax language is moderately analytic",
    "It has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning",
    "Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect",
    "Basic constituent orderEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic  to being almost exclusively subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO)",
    "The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as he had hoped to try to open it",
    "In most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order",
    "The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it",
    "The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb:The dogbitesthe manSVOThe manbitesthe dogSVOAn exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form",
    "The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:HehithimSVOIndirect objects (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as I gave Jane the book or in a prepositional phrase, such as I gave the book to Jane",

    "A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs",
    "Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause",
    "Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause",
    "For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying",
    "The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted",
    "Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter, the object of the main clause",
    "Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted",
    ") In contrast to many other Germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses",
    "Auxiliary verb constructionsMain articles: Do-support, English auxiliary verbs, and Subject\u2013auxiliary inversionEnglish syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood",
    "Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb",
    "For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not",
    "Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions",
    "The verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in \"I did shut the fridge",
    "\" However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present",
    "Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in *I know not\u2014it can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used, to produce a form like I do not (don't) know",
    "The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions\u2014inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say *Know you him",
    "; grammatical rules require Do you know him",
    "Negation is done with the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb",
    "A contracted form of not -n't can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be",
    "Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him",
    ", but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English",
    "Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs",
    "A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase",
    "They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get",
    "For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her)",
    "QuestionsBoth yes\u2013no questions and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject\u2013auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow",
    ", Where can we eat",
    "), which may require do-support (Do you like her",
    ", Where did he go",
    "In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e",
    "what, who, where, when, why, how) appear in a fronted position",
    "For example, in the question What did you see",
    ", the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence",
    "(When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat",
    ") Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e",
    "To whose house did you go last night",
    "The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts",
    "Discourse level syntaxWhile English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment)",
    "Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence",
    "In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means",
    "One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee",
    "Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e",
    "it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee",
    "Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e",
    ", it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street)",
    "Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax",
    "Focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent",
    "For example, the girl was stung by a bee (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or The girl was stung by a bee (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy)",
    "Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause",
    "For example, That girl over there, she was stung by a bee, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, she was stung by a bee, that girl over there, where reference to the girl is established as an \"afterthought\"",
    "Cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e",
    "that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event)",
    "Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion",
    "Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences",
    "Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true",
    "(the idiomatic marker no way",
    "expressing disbelief), or boy",
    "I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis)",
    "While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers",
    "VocabularySee also: Foreign-language influences in Englishobsolete words are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the Oxford English Dictionaryspecies names, scientific terminology, botanical terms, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical acronyms",

    "One of the most productive processes in English is conversion, using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun",
    "Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding, producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick",
    "A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (-hood, -ness, -ing, -ility) to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of Latin or Greek origin)",
    "Formation of new words, called neologisms, based on Greek and/or Latin roots (for example television or optometry) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated",

    "It is not possible to speak or write English without Germanic words, but it is possible to write or speak many sentences in English without foreign loanwords",

    "English loanwords and calques in other languagesMain article: EnglishizationEnglish has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages",
    "The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages",
    "That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies",

    "Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace",
    "Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced",

    "These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English",
    "Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words",
    "Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling \u2014 for example, the words photograph, photography, and photographic, or the words electricity and electrical there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns",
    "The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world",
    "Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word",
    "Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds",
    "The letters b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, z represent, respectively, the phonemes /b, d, f, h, d\u0292, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/",

    "The single letter x is generally pronounced as /z/ in word-initial position and as /ks/ otherwise",
    "There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of Modern English to follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin",
    "For the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular",
    "There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (a, e, i, o, u, w, y)",
    "As a result, some \"\" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the oa in boat, the ow in how, and the ay in stay), or the historically based silent e (as in note and cake)",
    "The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in English",
    "It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German",

    "North American English is generally homogeneous compared to British English, but this has been disputed",
    "American accent variation is increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level, though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents, known collectively as General American English (GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves, including Midland and Western American English",
    "In most American and Canadian English dialects, rhoticity (or r-fulness) is dominant, with non-rhoticity (or r-dropping) being associated with lower prestige and social class, especially since the end of World War II",
    "This contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard",
    "The English language is far and away the most widely used language in the United States",
    "Its roots trace back to the British colonial era, which began with the settlement in present-day Jamestown, VirginiaGerman was the predominant language among German immigrants, who arrived primarily in eastern Pennsylvania, English was ultimately widely adopted throughout the Thirteen Colonies that ultimately launched both the American Revolution and American Revolutionary War against the Kingdom of Great Britain, then rules by King George IIISeparate from the General American English are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems that have developed over time, including Southern American English, English of the coastal Northeastern United States, including Eastern New England English, New York City English, and African-American Vernacular English, all of which are historically non-rhotic",
    "Canadian English varieties, except for those of the Atlantic provinces and perhaps Quebec, are also classified as General American English, although they often show raising of the vowels /a\u026a/ and /a\u028a/ before voiceless consonants and have distinct written and pronunciation norms as well",
    "In Southern American English, the most populous American \"accent group\" outside of the General American English, rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's historical non-rhotic prestige",
    "Southern accents are colloquially described as a \"drawl\" or \"twang\", being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by glide-deleting in the /a\u026a/ vowel (e",

    "Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties",

    "Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English-based creole, combining English and African languages",
    "The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole",
    "In Central America, English-based creoles are spoken on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama",
    "Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and code-switching between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as \"basilect\" and the more RP-like forms serving as the \"acrolect\", the most formal register",
    "Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic",
    "Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English",

    "Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that \"child\" is pronounced [t\u0361\u0283ail] and \"wind\" [win]",
    "As a historical legacy, Indian English tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers",
    "Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as /t/ and /d/ (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as [\u0288] and [\u0256]) and the replacement of /\u03b8/ and /\u00f0/ with dentals [t\u032a] and [d\u032a]",

    "AbishabisCree religious leader",
    "He became the prophet of a religious movement that spread among the Cree communities of northern Manitoba and OntarioHudson's Bay CompanyFirst Nations family living near York Factory, in present-day Manitoba",
    "He was arrested and imprisoned at Fort Severn, where a group of people forcibly removed him from his jail cell, murdered him and burned his body",
    "His followers slowly disavowed his teachings and destroyed their relics from the movement or practiced their religion in secret",
    "John Montgomery Cooper reported that stories about Abishabis were passed down by the Cree people, who claimed that Abishabis had introduced Christianity to them",
    "Early life and backgroundAbishabis was Omushkego Cree, referred to as \"Home Guard Indians\" by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC)",
    "The Cree were one of several groups of Indigenous people who served as intermediaries between the HBC and Indigenous fur trappers",
    "The company became dependent upon the Indigenous workforce to provide goods (such as fur) that they sold in Europe and provide skilled and unskilled labour to sustain the trading posts the HBC established",
    "Abishabis was from a district that contained York Factory, a HBC trading post",
    "His group traded with the company since the trading post was established",
    "The Omushkego Cree relied upon guns to hunt animals, and the furs from these animals were traded to the HBC",
    "In the years preceding Abishabis's religious pursuits, the group believed something was wrong with their hunting grounds, as they struggled to hunt caribou",
    "James Hargrave, an officer with the HBC, wrote that there was nothing remarkable about Abishabis before the arrival of Methodist missionaries to the area",
    "Religious activityManitoba) and Moose River (in what is now Ontario)",
    "His movement would later be known as \"Track to Heaven\"",
    "Abishabis's movement was supported by tithes from his followers; as his following grew, he accumulated goods and more wives, a traditional sign of success among the Cree",
    "His followers expected Abishabis to provide gifts that equaled the resources that were provided by Methodist missionaries and the HBC",
    "Meanwhile, colonists and businessmen from Europe were concerned about Abishabis's preaching, as his followers were less likely to hunt for furs, hurting their profits",
    "They also reported that followers relied upon wooden carvings for salvation and neglected the consumption of food or drink, causing some of them to starve to death",
    "The HBC and the Methodist missionaries were united in refusing to recognise Abishabis's authority amongst his group",
    "George Barnston condemned Abishabis's teachings as false and manipulation from the Devil, then destroyed an artifact from the leader's group that depicted a \"track to heaven\" by burning it",
    "One day after prayers, Abishabis approached Hargrave to shake his hand; the Cree considered a handshake as a ritualistic action, and Abishabis intended for this to signal the HBC's support of his group",
    "Hargrave refused, indicating to the Cree people that the Cree leader could not obtain resources from the company",
    "Support further weakened when Abishabis asked for more wives (some of whom were already married to other followers) As his following and influence waned, he was unable to support his wives, many of whom returned to their families",
    "Arrest and deathSevern House",
    "He was accused of murdering an Indigenous family in the York Factory area and taking some of their possessions",
    "Researcher Norman James Williamson stated that it was difficult to corroborate this story, as this version of events was reported to the HBC by the Cree and elaborated upon by Hargrave's wife, Letitia",
    "Abishabis arrived in Severn House several days after the killings and spent a couple of days there, bothering the population and refusing to leave",
    "Hargrave sent an interpreter named John Cromartie to Severn House with orders to incite the Cree population to kill Abishabis by accusing him of being a windigo",
    "After analysing Hargrave's actions and reports, Norman Williamson stated that this order was given because Hargrave feared an uprising from the Cree against the HBC, led by Abishabis",
    "Cromartie wrote of Indigenous people's claims that Abishabis was threatening them if they did not give him resources",
    "Abishabis was questioned about the murders in York Factory by Cromartie and denied involvement",
    "Letitia, in a letter to her mother, reported that the man who struck the final blow was named Towers",
    "The men brought Abishabis's body to a nearby island and burned it, declaring that he might have been a windigo and that they wanted to prevent him from haunting them",
    "Religious viewsIt is difficult to establish Abishabis's religious beliefs before his preaching because the Cree were not forthcoming about their beliefs when speaking to Europeans",
    "The ultimate goal in the Cree religion was to journey to the afterlife, located in the remote west",
    "This differed from the Christian concept of heaven as a place in the sky for morally good people, and thus the Cree struggled to understand the Christian concept when it was explained to them by missionaries",
    "James Evans teaching his Cree syllabic writing system, upon which Abishabis's religious relics were basedBefore beginning his ministry, Abishabis separated himself from the Cree and the HBC employees",
    "Upon his return, he stated that he had traveled to the sky to a place where he received blessings and information, including the deity's physical features",
    "Using a syllabic writing system, introduced to the Cree people by Methodist missionary James Evans, Abishabis and his associates created texts, charts, and pictographs with lines drawn upon wood or paper",
    "Academics have given several explanations for what these lines depicted",
    "Lee Irwin writes that they were seen as paths to heaven and hell; Philip H",
    "Round said they were used to determine the will of spirits, allowing the Cree to purify themselves",
    "Norman Williamson writes that the role of Abishabis's revelations was to determine possible futures for the Cree people; Timothy E",
    "Williamson said the writings included warnings against adopting European customs and promises of meat on Earth and rewards in heaven for following these teachings",
    "Abishabis taught his followers his technique so that they could create their own paths",
    "He also claimed to have received a book from God called \"Tracks to Heaven\"",
    "Abishabis's group was probably monotheistic, believing in a self-existing creator of the world",
    "Their deity was distant from the group and difficult to approach",
    "Methodists described Jesus to the Cree as an intermediary between humans and God, allowing humans to make requests to their deity",
    "Abishabis used the Methodist teachings as a foundation for the Cree to communicate with their own deity",
    "His followers observed the Sabbath, sang psalms, and painted books",
    "Some sources state that Abishabis referred to himself as Jesus",
    "Norman Williamson states that this was probably rhetoric from the Methodists, and that instead Abishabis claimed that Jesus had led his spiritual journey",
    "Abishabis's followers did not deify him and considered his teachings to be revelations of God's will",
    "They believed that the spirits called upon the Cree to recognise the leader as a prophet, replace the Methodist missionaries' books with religious texts created by Abishabis and his associates, and return to their pre-colonisation customs",
    "Abishabis claimed that he was the \"High Priest of the Tribe\"; Norman Williamson stated that Abishabis's ministry was successful because he was the first person to declare himself a Christian leader among his Cree community",
    "This allowed them to open themselves up to the possibility of a Cree person leading their Christian theological teachings",
    "Round said that the religion's success stemmed from merging Christian ideas with the familiarity of the Cree writing system, which promised Cree empowerment",
    "LegacyFollowers continued to adhere to Abishabis's teachings in the winter following his death, particularly among Indigenous people who were inland and unaware that he died",
    "The HBC and the Methodist church persecuted Abishabis's followers to eliminate this religious practice",
    "A woman and a boy spread Abishabis's teachings to the Albany Cree community; upon their discovery by the Methodists, they were forced to put their relics of Abishabis's teachings into a bonfire that was attended by Cree people and HBC employees",
    "Hargrave sent a report to the British government in London; their response praised Hargrave's efforts to have Abishabis killed",
    "Moose Factory were still under the influence of the religious teachings, which had also spread to Cree people in Eastmain",
    "George Simpson stated that enthusiasm for the teachings in the northern parts of his territory ended with Abishabis's death",
    "Followers began to conceal their faith when the influence of the HBC increased and as its workers showed disapproval of this interpretation of Christianity",
    "Other followers slowly disavowed Abishabis's teachings and destroyed materials that were inspired by him",
    "John Montgomery Cooper reported that Cree people in Moose Factory had passed down oral stories about the movement",
    "The Cree in Moose Factory stated that Abishabis had introduced Christianity to them",
    "Notes \"Small Eyes\" has been given in some sources as an alternate name",

    "In the case of disagreement, lodges could leave bands and bands could be formed and dissolved with relative ease",
    "However, as there is safety in numbers, all families would want to be part of some band, and banishment was considered a very serious punishment",
    "Bands would usually have strong ties to their neighbours through intermarriage and would assemble together at different parts of the year to hunt and socialize together",
    "Besides these regional gatherings, there was no higher-level formal structure, and decisions of war and peace were made by consensus with allied bands meeting together in council",
    "People could be identified by their clan, which is a group of people claiming descent from the same common ancestor; each clan would have a representative and a vote in all important councils held by the band (compare: Anishinaabe clan system)",
    "Each band remained independent of each other",
    "However, Cree-speaking bands tended to work together and with their neighbours against outside enemies",
    "Those Cree who moved onto the Great Plains and adopted bison hunting, called the Plains Cree, were allied with the Assiniboine, the Metis Nation, and the Saulteaux in what was known as the \"Iron Confederacy\", which was a major force in the North American fur tradeIndian trading networks on the northern plains",
    "When a band went to war, they would nominate a temporary military commander, called a okimahkanNorth-West Rebellion, Big Bear was the leader of his band, but once the fighting started Wandering Spirit became war leader",

    "The French colonists and explorers, who spelled the term Kilistinon, Kiristinon, Knisteneaux, Cristenaux, and Cristinaux, used the term for numerous tribes which they encountered north of Lake Superior, in Manitoba, and west of there",
    "The French used these terms to refer to various groups of peoples in Canada, some of which are now better distinguished as Severn Anishinaabe (Ojibwa), who speak dialects different from the Algonquin",
    "Depending on the community, the Cree may call themselves by the following names: the n\u0113hiyawak, n\u012bhithaw, n\u0113hilaw, and n\u0113hinaw; or ininiw, ililiw, iynu (innu), or iyyu",
    "These names are derived from the historical autonym n\u0113hiraw (of uncertain meaning) or from the historical autonym iriniw (meaning \"person\")",
    "Cree using the latter autonym tend to be those living in the territories of Quebec and Labrador",

    "The Cree language (also known in the most broad classification as Cree-Montagnais, Cree-Montagnais-Naskapi, to show the groups included within it) is the name for a group of closely related Algonquian languages,Northwest Territories to Labrador",
    "It is the most widely spoken aboriginal language in Canada",
    "The only region where Cree has official status is in the Northwest Territories, together with eight other aboriginal languages, French and English",
    "The two major groups: Nehiyaw and Innu, speak a mutually intelligible Cree dialect continuum, which can be divided by many criteria",
    "In a dialect continuum, \"It is not so much a language, as a chain of dialects, where speakers from one community can very easily understand their neighbours, but a Plains Cree speaker from Alberta would find a Quebec Cree speaker difficult to speak to without practice",
    "\"One major division between the groups is that the Eastern group palatalizes the sound /k/ to either /ts/ (c) or to /t\u0283/ (\u010d) when it precedes front vowels",
    "There is also a major difference in grammatical vocabulary (particles) between the groups",
    "Within both groups, another set of variations has arisen around the pronunciation of the Proto-Algonquian phoneme *l, which can be realized as /l/, /r/, /y/, /n/, or /\u00f0/ (th) by different groups",
    "Yet in other dialects, the distinction between /e\u02d0/ (\u0113) and /i\u02d0/ (\u012b) has been lost, merging to the latter",

    "The largest Cree band and the second largest First Nations Band in Canada after the Six Nations Iroquois is the Lac La Ronge Band in northern Saskatchewan",
    "Given the traditional Cree acceptance of mixed marriages, it is acknowledged by academics that all bands are ultimately of mixed heritage and multilingualism and multiculturalism was the norm",
    "In the West, mixed bands of Cree, Saulteaux and Assiniboine, all partners in the Iron Confederacy, are the norm",
    "However, in recent years, as indigenous languages have declined across western Canada where there were once three languages spoken on a given reserve, there may now only be one",
    "This has led to a simplification of identity, and it has become \"fashionable\" for bands in many parts of Saskatchewan to identify as \"Plains Cree\" at the expense of a mixed Cree-Salteaux history",
    "There is also a tendency for bands to recategorize themselves as \"Plains Cree\" instead of Woods Cree or Swampy Cree",
    "Neal McLeod argues this is partly due to the dominant culture's fascination with Plains Indian culture as well as the greater degree of written standardization and prestige Plains Cree enjoys over other Cree dialects",
    "The M\u00e9tis (from the French, M\u00e9tis \u2013 of mixed ancestry) are people of mixed ancestry, such as Cree  and French, English, or Scottish heritage",

    "These languages had no formal writing system previously",
    "They are valued for their distinctiveness from the Latin script and for the ease with which literacy can be achieved;Cree had achieved what may have been one of the highest rates of literacy in the world",
    "Syllabics are abugidas, where glyphs represent consonant-vowel pairs",
    "They derive from the work of James Evans",
    "Canadian syllabics are currently used to write all of the Cree languages from Naskapi (spoken in Quebec) to the Rocky Mountains, including Eastern Cree, Woods Cree, Swampy Cree and Plains Cree",
    "They are also used to write Inuktitut in the eastern Canadian Arctic; there they are co-official with the Latin script in the territory of Nunavut",
    "They are used regionally for the other large Canadian Algonquian language, Ojibwe, as well as for Blackfoot, where they are obsolete",
    "[clarification needed] Among the Athabaskan languages further to the west, syllabics have been used at one point or another to write Dakelh (Carrier), Chipewyan, Slavey, T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb (Dogrib) and Dane-zaa (Beaver)",

    "History[edit]Rev",
    "James Evans teaching his system of Cree syllabic writingJames Evans, a missionary, probably in collaboration with Indigenous language experts",
    "Evans formalized them for Swampy Cree and Ojibwe",
    "Evans had been inspired by the success of Sequoyah's Cherokee syllabary after encountering problems with Latin-based alphabets, and drew on his knowledge of Devanagari and Pitman shorthand",
    "Canadian syllabics would in turn influence the Pollard script, which is used to write various Hmong-Mien and Lolo-Burmese languages",
    "Other missionaries were reluctant to use it, but it was rapidly indigenized and spread to new communities before missionaries arrived",
    "Per these traditions, syllabics were the invention of Calling Badger, a Cree man",
    "Legend states that Badger had died and returned from the spirit world to share the knowledge of writing with his people",
    "Cree scholar Winona Stevenson explores the possibility that the inspiration for Cree syllabics may have originated from a near-death experience of mistanaskow\u00eaw (\u14a5\u1422\u1455\u14c7\u1422\u146f\u140d\u1424, Calling Badger \u2013 from mistanask \u14a5\u1422\u1455\u14c7\u1422\u1420 'badger' and -w\u00eaw \u1401\u1427\u1424 'voice/call'), a Cree",

    "() (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Devanagari combining forms compared to syllabicsKingston upon Hull, England, was placed in charge of the Wesleyan mission at Rice Lake, Ontario",
    "Here, he began to learn the eastern Ojibwe language spoken in the area and was part of a committee to devise a Latin alphabetSpeller and Interpreter in English and Indian, but was unable to get its printing sanctioned by the British and Foreign Bible Society",
    "At the time, many missionary societies were opposed to the development of native literacy in their own languages, believing that their situation would be bettered by linguistic assimilation into colonial society",
    "Evans continued to use his  in his work in Ontario",
    "As was common at the time, the orthography called for hyphens between the syllables of words, giving written Ojibwe a partially syllabic structure",
    "However, his students appear to have had conceptual difficulties using the same alphabet for two different languages with very different sounds, and Evans himself found this approach awkward",
    "Furthermore, the Ojibwe language was polysynthetic but had few distinct syllables, meaning that most words had a large number of syllables; this made them quite long when written with the Latin script",
    "He began to experiment with creating a more syllabic script that he thought might be less awkward for his students to use",
    "Norway House in northern Manitoba",
    "Here he began learning the local Swampy Cree dialect",
    "Like the closely related Ojibwe, it was full of long polysyllabic words",
    "As an amateur linguist, Evans was acquainted with the Devanagari script used in British India; in Devanagari, each letter stands for a syllable, and is modified to represent the vowel of that syllable",
    "Such a system, now called an abugida, would have readily lent itself to writing a language such as Swampy Cree, which had a simple syllable structure of only eight consonants and four long or short vowels",
    "Evans was also familiar with British shorthand, presumably Samuel Taylor's Universal Stenography, from his days as a merchant in England; and now he acquired familiarity with the newly published Pitman shorthandAdoption and use[edit]A modern typeface, The local Cree community quickly took to this new writing system",
    "Cree people began to use it to write messages on tree bark using burnt sticks, leaving messages out on hunting trails far from the mission",
    "Evans believed that it was well adapted to Native Canadian languages, particularly the Algonquian languages with which he was familiar",
    "He claimed that \"with some slight alterations\" it could be used to write \"every language from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains",
    "\"Evans attempted to secure a printing press and new type to publish materials in this writing system",
    "Here, he began to face resistance from colonial and European authorities",
    "The Hudson's Bay Company, which had a monopoly on foreign commerce in western Canada, refused to import a press for him, believing that native literacy was something to be discouraged",
    "Evans, with immense difficulty, constructed his own press and type and began publishing in syllabics",
    "David Anderson, the Anglican bishop of Rupert's Land, reported that \"a few of the Indians [sic] can read by means of these syllabic characters; but if they had only been taught to read their own language in our letters, it would have been one step towards the acquisition of the English tongue",
    "\" But syllabics had taken root among the Cree (indeed, their rate of literacy was greater than that of English and French CanadiansBritish and Foreign Bible Society published a Bible in Cree syllabics",
    "By then, both Protestant and Catholic missionaries were using and actively propagating syllabic writing",
    "Ojibwe dialects (Plains Ojibwe and Saulteaux), but it was not often used over the border by Ojibwe in the United States",

    "Attikamekw, Montagnais and Innu people in eastern Quebec and Labrador use Latin alphabets",
    "John Horden, an Anglican missionary at Moose Factory, Ontario, who adapted syllabics to the local James Bay Cree dialect, met a group of Inuit from the region of Grande Rivi\u00e8re de la Baleine in northern Quebec",
    "They were very interested in adapting Cree syllabics to their language",
    "He prepared a few based on their pronunciation of Inuktitut, but it quickly became obvious that the number of basic sounds and the simple model of the syllable in the Evans system was inadequate to the language",
    "With the assistance of Edwin Arthur Watkins, he dramatically modified syllabics to reflect these needs",
    "Anglican church hired Edmund Peck to work full-time in their mission at Great Whale River, teaching syllabics to the Inuit and translating materials into syllabics",
    "His work across the Arctic is usually credited with the establishment of syllabics among the Inuit",
    "With the support of both Anglican and CatholicJohn William Tims, an Anglican missionary from Great Britain, invented a number of new forms to write the Blackfoot language",
    "French Roman Catholic missionaries were the primary force for expanding syllabics to Athabaskan languagesOblate missionary order was particularly active in using syllabics in missionary work",

    "Fine Day of the Sweetgrass First Nation told Mandelbaum the following account:A Wood Cree named Badger-call died and then became alive again",
    "While he was dead he was given the characters of the syllabary and told that with them he could write Cree",
    "Strike-him-on-the-back learned this writing from Badger-call",
    "He made a feast and announced that he would teach it to anyone who wanted to learn",
    "That is how I learned it",
    "Badger-call also taught the writing to the missionaries",
    "When the writing was given to Badger-call he was told 'They [the missionaries] will change the script and will say that the writing belongs to them",
    "But only those who know Cree will be able to read it",
    "' That is how we know that the writing does not belong to the whites, for it can be read only by those who know the Cree language",
    "Fine Day's grandson Wes Fineday gave the following account on CBC radio MorningsideWhen asked whether the story was meant to be understood literally, Wes Fineday commented: \"The sacred stories",
    "are not designed necessarily to provide answers but merely to begin to point out directions that can be taken",
    "Understand that it is not the work of storytellers to bring answers to you",
    "What we can do is we can tell you stories and if you listen to those stories in the sacred manner with an open heart, an open mind, open eyes and open ears, those stories will speak to you",
    "\"Montana, was told a similar narrative by Raining Bird:Stevenson (aka Wheeler) comments that the legend is commonly known among the Cree",
    "However, there is no known surviving physical evidence of Canadian Aboriginal syllabics before Norway House",
    "Linguist Chris Harvey believes that the syllabics were a collaboration between English missionaries and Indigenous Cree- and Ojibwe-language experts, Such as the Ojibwe Henry Bird Steinhauer (Sowengisik) and Cree translator Sophie Mason, who worked alongside Evans at his time in Norway House",
    "Basic principles[edit]Canadian \"syllabic\" scripts are not syllabaries, in which every consonant\u2013vowel sequence has a separate glyph, but abugidas, in which consonants are modified in order to indicate an associated vowel\u2014in this case through a change in orientation (which is unique to Canadian syllabics)",
    "In Cree, for example, the consonant p has the shape of a chevron",
    "In an upward orientation, \u1431, it transcribes the syllable pi",
    "Inverted, so that it points downwards, \u142f, it transcribes pe",
    "Pointing to the left, \u1438, it is pa, and to the right, \u1433, po",

    "Indeed, computer fonts have separate coding points for each syllable (each orientation of each consonant), and the Unicode Consortium considers syllabics to be a \"featural syllabary\" along with such scripts as hangul, where each block represents a syllable, but consonants and vowels are indicated independently (in Cree syllabics, the consonant by the shape of a glyph, and the vowel by its orientation)",
    "This is unlike a true syllabary, where each combination of consonant and vowel has an independent form that is unrelated to other syllables with the same consonant or vowel",
    "Syllabic and final consonant forms[edit]The original script, which was designed for Western Swampy Cree, had ten such letterforms: eight for syllables based on the consonants p-, t-, c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y- (pronounced /p, t, ts, k, m, n, s, j/), another for vowel-initial syllables, and finally a blended form, now obsolete, for the consonant cluster sp-ka, \u1472 k\u00e2minuscules (\"lowercase\") and a heavier line indicated majuscules (\"uppercase\"): \u1472 ka, \u1472 KA or Katype sorts, such that in print the letterform was broken",
    "A handwritten variant using an overdot to indicate a long vowel is now used in printing as well: \u1455 ta, \u1456 t\u00e2",
    "One consonant, w, had no letterform of its own but was indicated by a diacritic on another syllable; this is because it could combine with any of the consonants, as in \u147f kwa, as well as existing on its own, as in \u1418 wa",
    "There were distinct letters for the nine consonants -p, -t, -c, -k, -m, -n, -s, -y, and w when they occurred at the end of a syllable",
    "In addition, four \"final\" consonants had no syllabic forms: -h, -l, -r, and the sequence -hk",
    "These were originally written midline, but are now superscripted",
    "(The glyph for -hk represents the most common final sequence of the language, being a common grammatical ending in Cree, and was used for common -nk in Ojibwe",
    ") The consonants -l and -r were marginal, only found in borrowings, baby talk, and the like",
    "These, and -h, could occur before vowels, but were written with the final shape regardless",
    "(-l and -r are now written the size of full letters when they occur before vowels, as the finals were originally, or in some syllabics scripts have been replaced with full rotating syllabic forms; -h only occurs before a vowel in joined morphemes, in couple grammatical words, or in pedagogical materials to indicate the consonant value following it is fortis",
    ")Vowel transformations[edit]The orientation of a perfectly symmetrical vowel triangle may be difficult to discern",
    "In the type of this Ojibwe sign, left-pointing a is an isosceles right-angled triangle, but upright i is acute-angled and isosceles",
    "The vowels fall into two sets, the back vowels -a and -u, and the front vowels -e and -i",
    "Each set consists of a lower vowel, -a or -e, and a higher vowel, -u or -i",
    "In all cases, back-vowel syllables are related through left-right reflection: that is, they are mirror images of each other",
    "How they relate to front-vowel syllables depends on the graphic form of the consonants",
    "These follow two patterns",
    "Symmetrical, vowel, p-, t-, sp-,c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y-,-e) syllables are derived this way from the low back-vowel (a) syllables, and the high front-vowel (-i) syllables are derived this way from the higher back-vowel (-u) syllables",
    "The symmetrical letter forms can be illustrated by arranging them into a diamond:\u1403i\u1431bi/pi\u144eti/di\u140a\u1405ao\u00a0\u1438\u1433ba/pabo/po\u00a0\u1455\u1450ta/dato/do\u1401e\u00a0\u142fbe/pe\u00a0\u144cte/deAnd the asymmetrical letter forms can be illustrated by arranging them into a square:\u146d\u146bgi/kige/ke\u00a0\u148b\u1489ji/cije/ce\u14a5\u14a3mime\u14c2\u14c0nine\u14ef\u14edsise\u1528\u1526yiye\u1472\u146fga/kago/ko\u1490\u148dja/cajo/co\u14aa\u14a7mamo\u14c7\u14c4nano\u14f4\u14f1saso\u152d\u152ayayoThese forms are present in most syllabics scripts with sounds values that approach their Swampy Cree origins",
    "For example, all scripts except the one for Blackfoot use the triangle for vowel-initial syllables",
    "a contrasts with \u140b \u00e2, and \u14a5 mi contrasts with \u14a6 m\u00ee",
    "Although Cree \u00ea only occurs long, the script made length distinctions for all four vowels",
    "Not all writers then or now indicate length, or do not do so consistently; since there is no contrast, no one today writes \u00ea as a long vowel",
    "Pointing[edit]Reflecting the shorthand principles on which it was based, syllabics may be written plain, indicating only the basic consonant\u2013vowel outline of speech, or pointed, with diacritics for vowel length and the consonants /w/ and /h/",
    "Full phonemic pointing is rare",
    "Syllabics may also be written without word division, as Devanagari once was, or with spaces or dots between words or prefixes",
    "Punctuation[edit]The only punctuation found in many texts is spacing between words and \u166e for a full stop",
    "Punctuation from the Latin script, including the period (",
    "), may also be used",
    "Due to the final c resembling a hyphen, a double hyphen \u27e8\u1400\u27e9 is used as the Canadian Aboriginal syllabics hyphen",
    "Glossary[edit]Some common terms as used in the context of syllabics\"Syllables\", or full-size letters[edit]The full-sized characters, whether standing for consonant-vowel combinations or vowels alone, are usually called \"syllables\"",
    "They may be phonemic rather than morphophonemic syllables",
    "That is, when one morpheme (word element) ends in a consonant and the next begins with a vowel, the intermediate consonant is written as a syllable with the following vowel",
    "For example, the Plains Cree word p\u012bhc-\u0101yi-hk \"indoors\" has p\u012bhc as its first morpheme, and \u0101yi as its second, but is written \u1432\u1426\u1491\u1528\u157d p\u012bh-c\u0101-yihk",
    "In other cases, a \"syllable\" may in fact represent only a consonant, again due to the underlying structure of the language",
    "In Plains Cree, \u1456\u14c2\u14ef t\u0101nisi \"hello\" or \"how are you",
    "\" is written as if it had three syllables",
    "Because the first syllable has the stress and the syllable that follows has a short /i/, the vowel is dropped",
    "As a result, the word is pronounced \"t\u0101nsi\" with only two syllables",
    "Syllabication is important to determining stress in Algonquian languages, and vice versa, so this ambiguity in syllabics is relatively important in Algonquian languages",
    "Series[edit]Presentations style variations of the Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics SH-series in commonly available typefaces",
    "The word \"series\" is used for either a set of syllables with the same vowel, or a set with the same initial consonant",
    "Thus the n-series is the set of syllables that begin with n, and the o-series is the set of syllables that have o as their vowel regardless of their initial consonant",
    "\"Finals\", or reduced letters[edit]A series of small raised letters are called \"finals\"",
    "They are usually placed after a syllable to indicate a final consonant, as the \u157d -hk in \u1528\u157d yihk above",
    "However, the Cree consonant h, which only has a final form, begins a small number of function words such as \u1426\u140b\u1424 h\u0101w",
    "In such cases the \"final\" \u1426 represents an initial consonant and therefore precedes the syllable",
    "The use of diacritics to write consonants is unusual in abugidas",
    "However, it also occurs (independently) in the Lepcha script",
    "Finals are commonly employed in the extension of syllabics to languages it was not initially designed for",
    "In some of the Athabaskan alphabets, finals have been extended to appear at mid height after a syllable, lowered after a syllable, and at mid height before a syllable",
    "For example, Chipewyan and Slavey use the final \u141f in the latter position to indicate the initial consonant dl (/t\u026c/)",
    "In Naskapi, a small raised letter based on sa is used for consonant clusters that begin with /s/: \u150c spwa, \u150d stwa, \u150e skwa, and \u150f scwa",
    "The Cree languages the script was initially designed for had no such clusters",
    "In Inuktitut, something similar is used not to indicate sequences, but to represent additional consonants, rather as the digraphs ch, sh, th were used to extend the Latin letters c, s, t to represent additional consonants in English",
    "In Inuktitut, a raised na-ga is placed before the g- series, \u158f \u1591 \u1593, to form an ng- (/\u014b/) series, and a raised ra (uvular /\u0281/) is placed before syllables of the k- series, \u157f \u1581 \u1583, to form a uvular q- series",
    "Although the forms of these series have two parts, each is encoded into the Unicode standard as a single character",
    "Diacritics[edit]Other marks placed above or beside the syllable are called \"diacritics\"",
    "These include the dot placed above a syllable to mark a long vowel, as in \u14a6 m\u00ee, and the dot placed at mid height after the syllable (in western Cree dialects) or before the syllable (in eastern Cree dialects) to indicate a medial w, as in \u147f kwa",
    "These are all encoded as single characters in Unicode",
    "Diacritics used by other languages include a ring above on Moose Cree \u146c kay (encoded as \"kaai\"), head ring on Ojibwe \u1553 fe, head barb on Inuktitut \u15a4 lha, tail barb on West Cree \u158c ro, centred stroke (a small vertical bar) in Carrier \u15c7 ghee, centred dot in Carrier \u15c8 ghi, centred bar (a bar perpendicular to the body) in Cree \u15a8 thi, and a variety of other marks",
    "Such diacritics may or may not be separately encoded into Unicode",
    "There is no systematic way to distinguish elements that are parts of syllables from diacritics, or diacritics from finals, and academic discussions of syllabics are often inconsistent in their terminology",
    "Points and pointing[edit]The diacritic mark used to indicate vowel length is often referred to as a \"point\"",
    "Syllabics users do not always consistently mark vowel length, w, or h",
    "A text with these marked is called a \"pointed\" text; one without such marks is said to be \"unpointed\"",
    "Syllabaries and syllabics[edit]The word syllabary has two meanings: a writing system with a separate character for each syllable, but also a table of syllables, including any script arranged in a syllabic chart",
    "Evans' Latin Ojibwe alphabet, for example, was presented as a syllabary",
    "Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, the script itself, is thus distinct from a syllabary (syllabic chart) that displays them",
    "Round and Square[edit]Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics\u2014Round form and Square form comparisonWhile Greek, Latin, and Cyrillic have serif and sans-serif forms, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics generally do not",
    "Instead, like  and monospaced fonts, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics have a round form and a square form",
    "Round form, known in Cree as K\u00e2-w\u00e2wiy\u00eayaki, is akin to a proportional font, characterised by their smooth bowls, differing letter heights, and occupying a rectangular space",
    "Round form syllabics are more commonly found east of Lake Winnipeg",
    "[citation needed] Square form, known in Cree as K\u00e2-ayisaw\u00eayaki, is akin to a monospace font, characterised by their cornered bowls, same letter heights, and occupying a square space",
    "Square form syllabics are more commonly found west of Lake Winnipeg",
    "Syllabic alphabets[edit]The inventory, form, and orthography of the script vary among all the Cree communities which use it",
    "However, it was further modified to create specific alphabets for other Algonquian languages, as well as for Inuit, which have significant phonological differences from Cree",
    "There are two major variants of the script, Central Algonquian and Inuktitut",

    "He became the prophet of a religious movement that spread among the Cree communities of northern Manitoba and OntarioHudson's Bay CompanyFirst Nations family living near York Factory, in present-day Manitoba",
    "He was arrested and imprisoned at Fort Severn, where a group of people forcibly removed him from his jail cell, murdered him and burned his body",
    "His followers slowly disavowed his teachings and destroyed their relics from the movement or practiced their religion in secret",
    "John Montgomery Cooper reported that stories about Abishabis were passed down by the Cree people, who claimed that Abishabis had introduced Christianity to them",
    "Early life and backgroundAbishabis was Omushkego Cree, referred to as \"Home Guard Indians\" by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC)",
    "The Cree were one of several groups of Indigenous people who served as intermediaries between the HBC and Indigenous fur trappers",
    "The company became dependent upon the Indigenous workforce to provide goods (such as fur) that they sold in Europe and provide skilled and unskilled labour to sustain the trading posts the HBC established",
    "Abishabis was from a district that contained York Factory, a HBC trading post",
    "His group traded with the company since the trading post was established",
    "The Omushkego Cree relied upon guns to hunt animals, and the furs from these animals were traded to the HBC",
    "In the years preceding Abishabis's religious pursuits, the group believed something was wrong with their hunting grounds, as they struggled to hunt caribou",
    "James Hargrave, an officer with the HBC, wrote that there was nothing remarkable about Abishabis before the arrival of Methodist missionaries to the area",
    "Religious activityManitoba) and Moose River (in what is now Ontario)",
    "His movement would later be known as \"Track to Heaven\"",
    "Abishabis's movement was supported by tithes from his followers; as his following grew, he accumulated goods and more wives, a traditional sign of success among the Cree",
    "His followers expected Abishabis to provide gifts that equaled the resources that were provided by Methodist missionaries and the HBC",
    "Meanwhile, colonists and businessmen from Europe were concerned about Abishabis's preaching, as his followers were less likely to hunt for furs, hurting their profits",
    "They also reported that followers relied upon wooden carvings for salvation and neglected the consumption of food or drink, causing some of them to starve to death",
    "The HBC and the Methodist missionaries were united in refusing to recognise Abishabis's authority amongst his group",
    "George Barnston condemned Abishabis's teachings as false and manipulation from the Devil, then destroyed an artifact from the leader's group that depicted a \"track to heaven\" by burning it",
    "One day after prayers, Abishabis approached Hargrave to shake his hand; the Cree considered a handshake as a ritualistic action, and Abishabis intended for this to signal the HBC's support of his group",
    "Hargrave refused, indicating to the Cree people that the Cree leader could not obtain resources from the company",
    "Support further weakened when Abishabis asked for more wives (some of whom were already married to other followers) As his following and influence waned, he was unable to support his wives, many of whom returned to their families",
    "Arrest and deathSevern House",
    "He was accused of murdering an Indigenous family in the York Factory area and taking some of their possessions",
    "Researcher Norman James Williamson stated that it was difficult to corroborate this story, as this version of events was reported to the HBC by the Cree and elaborated upon by Hargrave's wife, Letitia",
    "Abishabis arrived in Severn House several days after the killings and spent a couple of days there, bothering the population and refusing to leave",
    "Hargrave sent an interpreter named John Cromartie to Severn House with orders to incite the Cree population to kill Abishabis by accusing him of being a windigo",
    "After analysing Hargrave's actions and reports, Norman Williamson stated that this order was given because Hargrave feared an uprising from the Cree against the HBC, led by Abishabis",
    "Cromartie wrote of Indigenous people's claims that Abishabis was threatening them if they did not give him resources",
    "Abishabis was questioned about the murders in York Factory by Cromartie and denied involvement",
    "Letitia, in a letter to her mother, reported that the man who struck the final blow was named Towers",
    "The men brought Abishabis's body to a nearby island and burned it, declaring that he might have been a windigo and that they wanted to prevent him from haunting them",
    "Religious viewsIt is difficult to establish Abishabis's religious beliefs before his preaching because the Cree were not forthcoming about their beliefs when speaking to Europeans",
    "The ultimate goal in the Cree religion was to journey to the afterlife, located in the remote west",
    "This differed from the Christian concept of heaven as a place in the sky for morally good people, and thus the Cree struggled to understand the Christian concept when it was explained to them by missionaries",
    "James Evans teaching his Cree syllabic writing system, upon which Abishabis's religious relics were basedBefore beginning his ministry, Abishabis separated himself from the Cree and the HBC employees",
    "Upon his return, he stated that he had traveled to the sky to a place where he received blessings and information, including the deity's physical features",
    "Using a syllabic writing system, introduced to the Cree people by Methodist missionary James Evans, Abishabis and his associates created texts, charts, and pictographs with lines drawn upon wood or paper",
    "Academics have given several explanations for what these lines depicted",
    "Lee Irwin writes that they were seen as paths to heaven and hell; Philip H",
    "Round said they were used to determine the will of spirits, allowing the Cree to purify themselves",
    "Norman Williamson writes that the role of Abishabis's revelations was to determine possible futures for the Cree people; Timothy E",
    "Williamson said the writings included warnings against adopting European customs and promises of meat on Earth and rewards in heaven for following these teachings",
    "Abishabis taught his followers his technique so that they could create their own paths",
    "He also claimed to have received a book from God called \"Tracks to Heaven\"",
    "Abishabis's group was probably monotheistic, believing in a self-existing creator of the world",
    "Their deity was distant from the group and difficult to approach",
    "Methodists described Jesus to the Cree as an intermediary between humans and God, allowing humans to make requests to their deity",
    "Abishabis used the Methodist teachings as a foundation for the Cree to communicate with their own deity",
    "His followers observed the Sabbath, sang psalms, and painted books",
    "Some sources state that Abishabis referred to himself as Jesus",
    "Norman Williamson states that this was probably rhetoric from the Methodists, and that instead Abishabis claimed that Jesus had led his spiritual journey",
    "Abishabis's followers did not deify him and considered his teachings to be revelations of God's will",
    "They believed that the spirits called upon the Cree to recognise the leader as a prophet, replace the Methodist missionaries' books with religious texts created by Abishabis and his associates, and return to their pre-colonisation customs",
    "Abishabis claimed that he was the \"High Priest of the Tribe\"; Norman Williamson stated that Abishabis's ministry was successful because he was the first person to declare himself a Christian leader among his Cree community",
    "This allowed them to open themselves up to the possibility of a Cree person leading their Christian theological teachings",
    "Round said that the religion's success stemmed from merging Christian ideas with the familiarity of the Cree writing system, which promised Cree empowerment",
    "LegacyFollowers continued to adhere to Abishabis's teachings in the winter following his death, particularly among Indigenous people who were inland and unaware that he died",
    "The HBC and the Methodist church persecuted Abishabis's followers to eliminate this religious practice",
    "A woman and a boy spread Abishabis's teachings to the Albany Cree community; upon their discovery by the Methodists, they were forced to put their relics of Abishabis's teachings into a bonfire that was attended by Cree people and HBC employees",
    "Hargrave sent a report to the British government in London; their response praised Hargrave's efforts to have Abishabis killed",
    "Moose Factory were still under the influence of the religious teachings, which had also spread to Cree people in Eastmain",
    "George Simpson stated that enthusiasm for the teachings in the northern parts of his territory ended with Abishabis's death",
    "Followers began to conceal their faith when the influence of the HBC increased and as its workers showed disapproval of this interpretation of Christianity",
    "Other followers slowly disavowed Abishabis's teachings and destroyed materials that were inspired by him",
    "John Montgomery Cooper reported that Cree people in Moose Factory had passed down oral stories about the movement",
    "The Cree in Moose Factory stated that Abishabis had introduced Christianity to them",
    "Notes \"Small Eyes\" has been given in some sources as an alternate name",
    "Some sources explicitly state that Abishabis murdered these people;  others state he was accused or suspected of murdering them by HBC employees",
    "Norman Williamson reports that the dead included Abishabis's father-in-law and his family",

    "Living things grouping together, usually for common benefitA colony of Brandt's cormorants in Point Lobos, CaliforniaIn biology, a colony is composed of two or more conspecific individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another",
    "This association is usually for mutual benefit such as stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey",
    "Colonies can form in various shapes and ways depending on the organism involved",
    "For instance, the bacterial colony is a cluster of identical cells (clones)",
    "These colonies often form and grow on the surface of (or within) a solid medium, usually derived from a single parent cell",
    "Colonies, in the context of development, may be composed of two or more unitary (or solitary) organisms or be modular organisms",
    "Unitary organisms have determinate development (set life stages) from zygote to adult form and individuals or groups of individuals (colonies) are visually distinct",
    "Modular organisms have indeterminate growth forms (life stages not set) through repeated iteration of genetically identical modules (or individuals), and it can be difficult to distinguish between the colony as a whole and the modules within",
    "In the latter case, modules may have specific functions within the colony",
    "In contrast, solitary organisms do not associate with colonies; they are ones in which all individuals live independently and have all of the functions needed to survive and reproduce",
    "Some organisms are primarily independent and form facultative colonies in reply to environmental conditions while others must live in a colony to survive (obligate)",
    "For example, some carpenter bees will form colonies when a dominant hierarchy is formed between two or more nest foundresses (facultative colony), while corals are animals that are physically connected by living tissue (the coenosarc) that contains a shared gastrovascular cavity",
    "Colony types[edit]Social colonies[edit]A breeding colony of northern gannets on the Heligoland archipelago in the North Sea",
    "Unicellular and multicellular unitary organisms may aggregate to form colonies",
    "For example,Protists such as slime molds are many unicellular organisms that aggregate to form colonies when food resources are hard to come by, as together they are more reactive to chemical cues released by preferred prey",
    "Eusocial insects like ants and honey bees are multicellular animals that live in colonies with a highly organized social structure",
    "Colonies of some social insects may be deemed superorganisms",
    "Animals, such as humans and rodents, form breeding or nesting colonies, potentially for more successful mating and to better protect offspring",
    "The Bracken CaveMexican free-tailed bats, making it the largest known concentration of mammals",
    "Modular organisms[edit]The pelagic Marrus orthocanna is a colonial siphonophore assembled from two types of zooidsModular organisms are those in which a genet (or genetic individual formed from a sexually-produced zygote) asexually reproduces to form genetically identical clones called ramets",
    "A clonal colony is when the ramets of a genet live in close proximity or are physically connected",
    "Ramets may have all of the functions needed to survive on their own or be interdependent on other ramets",
    "For example, some sea anemones go through the process of pedal laceration in which a genetically identical individual is asexually produced from tissue broken off from the anemone's pedal disc",
    "In plants, clonal colonies are created through the propagation of genetically identical trees by stolons or rhizomes",
    "Colonial organisms are clonal colonies composed of many physically connected, interdependent individuals",
    "The subunits of colonial organisms can be unicellular, as in the alga Volvox (a coenobium), or multicellular, as in the phylum Bryozoa",
    "Colonial organisms may have been the first step toward multicellular organisms",
    "Individuals within a multicellular colonial organism may be called ramets, modules, or zooids",
    "Structural and functional variation (polymorphism), when present, designates ramet responsibilities such as feeding, reproduction, and defense",
    "To that end, being physically connected allows the colonial organism to distribute nutrients and energy obtained by feeding zooids throughout the colony",
    "The hydrozoan Portuguese man o' war is a classic example of a colonial organism, one of many in the taxonomic class",
    "Microbial colonies[edit]A microbial colony  is defined as a visible cluster of microorganisms growing on the surface of or within a solid medium, presumably cultured from a single cell",
    "Because the colony is clonal, with all organisms in it descending from a single ancestor (assuming no contamination), they are genetically identical, except for any mutations (which occur at low frequencies)",
    "Obtaining such genetically identical organisms (or pure strains) can be useful; this is done by spreading organisms on a culture plate and starting a new stock from a single resulting colony",
    "A biofilm is a colony of microorganisms often comprising several species, with properties and capabilities greater than the aggregate of capabilities of the individual organisms[citation needed]",
    "Colony ontogeny for eusocial insects[edit]Colony ontogeny refers to the developmental process and progression of a colony",
    "It describes the various stages and changes that occur within a colony from its initial formation to its mature state",
    "The exact duration and dynamics of colony ontogeny can vary greatly depending on the species and environmental conditions",
    "Factors such as resource availability, competition, and environmental cues can influence the progression and outcome of colony development",
    "[citation needed]During colony ontogeny for eusocial insects such as ants and bees, a colony goes through several distinct phases, each characterised by specific behavioural patterns, division of labor, and structural modifications",
    "While the exact details can vary depending on the species, the general progression typically involves a number of well-defined stages, detailed below",
    "Founding stage[edit]In this initial stage, a single female individual or small group of female individuals, often called the foundress(es), queen(s) (and kings for termites) or primary reproductive(s), establish a new colony",
    "The foundresses build a basic nest structure and begin to lay eggs",
    "The foundresses can also perform non-reproductive tasks at this early stage, such as nursing these first eggs and leaving the nest to gather resources",
    "Worker emergence[edit]This is also known as the ergonomic stage",
    "As the eggs laid by the foundresses develop, they give rise to the first generation of workers",
    "These workers can assume various tasks, such as foraging, brood care, and nest maintenance",
    "Initially, the worker population is relatively small, and their tasks are not as specialised",
    "As the colony grows, more workers emerge, and the division of labor becomes more pronounced",
    "Some individuals may specialise in tasks like foraging, defense, or tending to the brood, while others may take on general tasks within the nest",
    "These specialised tasks can change throughout the life of a worker",
    "Reproductive phase[edit]At a certain point in the colony ontogeny, usually after a period of growth and maturation, the colony produces reproductives, including new virgin queens (princesses) and males",
    "These individuals have the potential to leave the nest and start new colonies, ensuring the transmission of the gene pool of its natal colony",
    "Colony death[edit]Over time, colonies may go through a senescence phase where the reproductive output declines, and the colony's overall vitality diminishes",
    "Eventually, the colony may die off or be replaced by a new generation of reproductives",
    "After the death of the queen in a monogyne colony, possible fates other than colony death include serial polygyny (when a virgin queen of the colony replaces the dead queen as the primary reproductive) or colony inheritance (when a worker takes over as primary reproductive)",
    "[citation needed]Life history[edit]Individuals in social colonies and modular organisms receive benefit to such a lifestyle",
    "For example, it may be easier to seek out food, defend a nesting site, or increase competitive ability against other species",
    "Modular organisms' ability to reproduce asexually in addition to sexually allows them unique benefits that social colonies do not have",
    "The energy required for sexual reproduction varies based on the frequency and length of reproductive activity, number and size of offspring, and parental care",
    "While solitary individuals bear all of those energy costs, individuals in some social colonies share a portion of those costs",
    "[citation needed]Modular organisms save energy by using asexual reproduction during their life",
    "Energy reserved in this way allows them to put more energy towards colony growth, regenerating lost modules (due to predation or other cause of death), or response to environmental conditions",

    "However, as a result of changing social structures, broader access to school education and the spread of mass media, the tradition is slowly dying out",
    "Background[edit]Hikaye are a unique form of literature, taking the form of educational folk tales passed down orally by older, Palestinian women to other younger women and children",
    "Usually performed in the fallahi or madani dialects of Arabic, they are intended for entertainment and education, and are mostly performed in a domestic environment, usually in winter",
    "Typically recited using an expressive tone, these spoken works discuss social issues and histories, particularly those that impact women",
    "They may criticise society to provoke discussion and debate, or may have an archival function recording memories of displacement",

    "The bid to UNESCO was prepared with community organisations, such as the Arab Women's Union, the Society of Insha al-Usra, and the Qattan Foundation, amongst others",
    "Decline[edit]Hikaye is in decline due to the influence of mass media, which often induce people to regard their native customs as backward and inferior",
    "As a consequence, the elder women tend to change form and content of the narrations",

    "roborowskiiBinomial nameTeratoscincus roborowskiiBedriagaTeratoscincus roborowskii, commonly known as the Tibetan wonder gecko or Turpan wonder gecko, is a species of gecko in the family Sphaerodactylidae",
    "The species is endemic to the Turpan Depression in Xinjiang, northwestern China, where it occurs in arid shrubland and desert habitats",
    "It reaches a snout-vent lengthThis lizard is a nocturnal and ground-dwelling species, emerging from its burrow to forage at night",
    "Its diet shifts seasonally, feeding mainly on insects in spring and fruit in summer and autumn",
    "The fruit of the caper bush is an important food item in certain months, and the gecko is also a seed disperser for this plant",
    "During the winter, this reptile hibernates in its burrow",
    "Juveniles of this species are known to curl their tails forwards when threatened, most likely to mimic venomous scorpions and avoid predation",
    "They are also similar in size, color and running patterns to Mesobuthus scorpions, further supporting the idea that they exhibit Batesian mimicry",
    "Taxonomy[edit]This species was first describedJacques von Bedriaga, and the specific name, roborowskii, honors Russian explorer Vladimir Ivanovich Roborovski",
    "It was formerly synonymized with Teratoscincus scincus and Teratoscincus przewalskii, but molecular and morphological analyses have supported its status as a distinct and valid species",
    "Although the holotypeDunhuang) in Gansu, China, this is believed to be an error as newer studies find that the species is absent there",
    "This is likely due to mixing of museum labels while examining the specimen, and the holotype is probably from the Turpan Depression of Xinjiang, China",
    "The species is commonly referred to as the Tibetan or Turpan wonder gecko in reference to its range",
    "Distribution and habitat[edit]View of the desert environment in the Turpan DepressionThe Turpan wonder gecko is endemic to the Turpan Depression in Xinjiang, China, where it occurs in sandy areas such as shrubland and deserts",
    "Older records of it being found in Gansu are now believed to be erroneous",
    "Its habitat is arid, with an average annual precipitationsea level, and has an estimated extent of occurrence Dead wood is an important microhabitat for the species, providing shelter, foraging and thermoregulation",
    "Description[edit]Wild individual near the Turpan Eremophyte Botanic GardenA moderately sized lizard, the adults of this species reach a snout-vent lengthsexual dimorphism This species has large eyes, while the snout and tail are short",
    "The scales on the head are small, while those on the torso and tail are large and overlapping",
    "The large cycloid scales on the back of the neck are arranged tapering from the forelimb level to the ear level, a feature distinguishing this species from the related common wonder gecko and Przewalski's wonder gecko",
    "Adults have a largely orange background color with irregular dark spots on the upper surface, while the underside and flanks are lighter",
    "Juveniles have thin dark crossbands on the upper surface that are lost with age",
    "Five to eight of these bands may be present on the body and four to six may be on the tail, but most commonly there are seven and five bands on the body and tail respectively",
    "This patterning may be mimicry of Mesobuthus scorpions, which have seven body plates and five tail segments",
    "Behavior and ecology[edit]This reptile is a nocturnal species, retreating to burrowshibernates in its burrow from October to late March",
    "Though mostly solitary, male-female pairs have been seen emerging from the same burrows",
    "It is a ground-dwelling species that forages mostly near or under vegetation, and may flee towards shrubs if disturbed on bare ground",
    "The species is oviparous, and the females lay clutches of one or two eggs among shrubs",
    "Diet[edit]Individual eating a ripe caper fruitThis lizard is an omnivorous species with a varied diet",
    "It is primarily carnivorousants, darkling beetles and ground beetles, whereas from June to September plant fruits become a significant food item and darkling beetles are consumed less",
    "This shift in diet seasonally alters the gut flora of the lizard, with lower microbiota diversity but more different phyla and families present in autumn than in spring",
    "The fruit of the caper This gecko has a mutualistic relationship with the caper bush as it is an effective disperser of the plant's seeds",
    "Retention in the digestive system of the gecko is found to enhance the permeability of caper seed coats, which increases germination rate, breaks dormancy and enhances water uptake of the seeds",
    "In addition, the lizard commonly excretes the seeds via defecation in areas suitable for germination",
    "Burrowing[edit]hibernationMortality and defence[edit]Like other small reptiles, T",
    "roborowskii is a prey item to various animals",
    "Potential predators of this lizard include the little owl, red fox and Tartar sand boa",
    "Juveniles may even fall victim to cannibalism, and an adult has been reported to have regurgitated a juvenile in a sack, presumably after the predation had occurred within said sack",

    "It is known to autotomize its tail in defence, and individuals with regenerated tails can be observed",
    "When threatened, adults are reported to take an arched posture while waving their tails from side to side, the tail scales making a hissing sound (presumably to intimidate predators)",
    "Juveniles may stiffen their bodies and curl their tails forward in a scorpion-like pose when provoked, which is believed to be Batesian mimicry of Mesobuthus scorpions",
    "In addition, the juveniles are similar in size, coloration and escape behavior to these scorpions, making it difficult to distinguish between the two during their moonlit foraging hours, further supporting this theory",
    "When fleeing, the adult lizard tends to run in a zigzag pattern and for longer distances than the juvenile, which generally runs a short distance in a straight line similar to the Mesobuthus scorpions",

    "A ripe caper fruit (caper berry)In Biblical times, the caper berry was supposed to have aphrodisiac properties; the Hebrew word aviyyonah (\u05d0\u05b2\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4) for caperberry is closely linked to the Hebrew root \u05d0\u05d1\u05d4 (avah), meaning \"desire\"",
    "The word occurs once in the Bible, in the book of Ecclesiastes, at verse",
    "The King James Version translates based on the Hebrew root (and perhaps the metaphorical meaning):",
    "the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail",
    "( KJV)The medieval Jewish commentator Rashi also gives a similar gloss ( ME)",
    "However, ancient translations, including the Septuagint, Vulgate, Peshitta and Aquila, render the word more concretely as \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2, \"caper berry\"",
    "Thus in the words of one modern idiomatic",

    "The berries (abiyyonot) were eaten, as appears from their liability to tithes and the restrictions of the 'Orlah",
    "They are carefully distinguished in the Mishnah and the Talmud from the caper leaves, alin, shoots, temarot, and the caper buds, capperisin (note the similarity \"caper\"isin to \"caper\"); all of which were eaten as seen from the blessing requirement, and declared to be the fruit of the \u1e93elaf or caper plant",
    "The \"capperisin\" mentioned in the Talmud are actually referring to a shell that protected the \"abiyyonot\" as it grew",

    "palpebrosus, both from South America",
    "Paleosuchus is distinguished from other caimans in the alligator subfamily Caimaninae by the absence of an interorbital ridge and the presence of four teeth in the premaxilla region of the jaw, where other species of caimans have five",
    "The genus name Paleosuchus is derived from the Greek palaios meaning \"ancient\" and soukhosspecific name palpebrosus is derived from the Latin palpebra meaning \"eyelid\" and osus meaning \"full of\"",
    "This refers to the bony plates (palpebrals) present on the upper eyelids",

    "In the pet trade, it is sometimes referred to as the wedge-head caiman",
    "Description[edit]Cuvier's dwarf caiman is the smallest living New World This may be an underestimate of the animal's maximum size, as nearly all large adults have lost the tips of their tails and the largest specimen measured in the Pantanal region had a snout\u2013vent length Cuvier's dwarf caiman has strong body armor on both its dorsal (upper) and ventral (lower) sides, which may compensate for its small body size in reducing predation",
    "The dermal scales providing this protection have a bony base and are known as osteoderms",
    "scutes are less prominent than in the smooth-fronted caiman",
    "The double rows of scutes on the tail are small and project vertically",
    "Adults are dark brownish-black with a dark brown head, while juveniles are brown with black bands",
    "The irises of the eyes are chestnut brown at all ages and the pupils are vertical slits",
    "Scale arrangement is useful for identifying Cuvier's dwarf caiman",
    "The scutellation (arrangement of the scales) helps to distinguish Cuvier's dwarf caiman from Schneider's dwarf caiman",

    "It is present in the drainages of the Orinoco River, the S\u00e3o Francisco River, and the Amazon River, and the upper reaches of the Paran\u00e1 River and the Paraguay River",
    "The countries in which it is found include Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Trinidad and Paraguay",
    "The range of this species is rather larger than that of the sympatric smooth-fronted caiman, as it extends into Paraguay and includes a larger area of Brazil",
    "Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a freshwater species and is found in forested riverine habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes",
    "It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, but it is also found in quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil",
    "It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and subadult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools",
    "In the northern and southern parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests in savanna country, but it is absent from such habitats in the Llanos and the Pantanal",
    "Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of caimans",
    "During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed",
    "Behaviour and ecology[edit]These caimans are mainly nocturnal",
    "Adults feed on fish, amphibians, small mammals, birds, crabs, shrimp, molluscs, insects, and other invertebrates, which they catch in the water or on land",
    "Juveniles eat fewer fish, but also consume crustaceans, tadpoles, frogs, and snails, as well as land invertebrates, such as beetles",
    "The prey is mostly swallowed whole and is ground up by stones in the gizzard",
    "In the Pantanal, Cuvier's dwarf caiman estivatesJuveniles at the Cologne Zoological Gardeneggs, hiding them under further vegetation",
    "The incubationmucusCuvier's dwarf caiman is considered to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms",
    "In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment",
    "The eggs and newly hatched young are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons, and other mammals",
    "Adults are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus), and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor)",
    "The Cuvier's dwarf caiman is the only crocodilian species that seemingly does not perform the near-universal \"death roll\" technique used by other extant crocodilians for feeding or intra-specific combat",
    "However, this may only be circumstantial, as specimens tested for the behavior may have been acting uncooperative with the researchers",
    "Status and conservation[edit]Many crocodilians are hunted for their skins, but this is not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman",
    "This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armored to make it easy to tan",
    "Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food, and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but no evidence shows that populations are dwindling as a result",
    "Some threats to this species are from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance",
    "The estimated total population is over a million individuals",
    "In its Red List of Threatened Species, the IUCN lists Cuvier's dwarf caiman as being of least concern, which is because its range is extensive, covering much of northern and central South America, and although its population trend is unknown, it appears to be abundant in many of the localities in which it is found",
    "It is listed in Appendix II of CITES",
    "Captive care[edit]Cuvier's dwarf caiman can be kept as a pet, though providing suitable care is expensive and requires extremely large enclosures",
    "In many countries, permits or licenses are necessary and most veterinarians have little experience with these exotic animals",

    "They might be books, newspapers, magazines, peer-reviewed scholarly journals and similarly high-quality websites",
    "Information on Wikipedia must be verifiable; if no reliable third-party sources can be found on a topic, then it should not have a separate article",
    "Please search Wikipedia first to make sure that an article does not already exist on the subject",
    "Generally, an article should closely follow Wikipedia policies and guidelines, specially:Neutral point of viewCoverage of a notable topicSupported by reliable sourcesAn Article Wizard is available to help you create an article through the Articles for Creation process, where it will be reviewed and considered for publication:Article wizardPlease consider looking at our introductory tutorial or reviewing contributing to Wikipedia to learn the basics about editing",

    "The basicsWikipedia is an encyclopedia written by volunteers to help people gain useful knowledge",
    "Our encyclopedia is pretty comprehensive, but that does not mean we would cover every single topic that exists",
    "Therefore, Wikipedia is not a social media, a place for promotion or advocacy, nor a place to announce new unpublished theories",
    "Information from websites, blogs, forum posts, social media, wikis including Wikipedia, and self-published sources are generally not suitable for Wikipedia",
    "In another way, our job is to summarize such high-quality and published sources from other places, in the form of Wikipedia articles",
    "That really is all we do",
    "Do make sure that anything you write on Wikipedia is based only on such sources",
    "Sounds easy",
    "Not quite",
    "Many of the notable topics have already been written by people in the past, and the fact of the matter is, most new articles nowadays are written about fairly obscure subjects",
    "That can make distinguishing topics that are suitable or not suitable on Wikipedia very difficult, and are often flashpoints for contentious disputes",
    "No amount of editing can overcome a lack of notability of a topicPlease avoid making an article that you have a conflict of interest in, meaning that you have a close connection to the subject as an employee, family member, friend, etc or your financial and other relationships",
    "This is a very strict policy on Wikipedia",
    "Conflicts of interest undermines public confidence and risks causing public embarrassment to the individuals and companies being promoted",
    "In practice, articles created out of a conflict of interest are usually rejected/deleted on sight",
    "(Further information: )If you want to succeed at this endeavor, you should gain ample of experience beforehand and get a feel of what a 'suitable' topic to write on Wikipedia would be",

    "References used to establish notability must meet additional criteria beyond reliability",
    "References used for specific facts need not meet these additional criteria",
    "To be suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia, a subject must have significant coverage in multiple reliable, independent sources",
    "All information in encyclopedia articles must be verifiable through citations",
    "As noted, the sources you use must be reliable: they must be sources that exercise some form of editorial control and have some reputation for fact-checking and accuracy",
    "Print sources (and web-based versions of those sources) tend to be the most reliable",
    "Examples include: books published by major publishing houses, newspapers, magazines, peer-reviewed scholarly journals, websites of any of the above, and other websites that meet the same requirements as a reputable print-based source",
    "In general, sources with no editorial control are not reliable",
    "These include (but are not limited to) books published by vanity presses, blogs, web forums, Reddit discussions, personal social media, fan sites, and other similar venues",
    "If anyone at all can post information without anyone else checking that information, it is probably not reliable",
    "Similarly, an opinion column in an otherwise reputable newspaper cannot help establish notability",
    "Many web sources feature user-generated content",
    "This anyone can sign up and create content",
    "All wikis are like this, including Wikipedia",
    "Also IMDB, Goodreads, YouTube, LinkedIn, and social media such as Twitter and Instagram",

    "This does not list things like books, or extremely reputable sources which are never questioned, like the Associated Press",
    "It does list many sources that have been debated frequently",
    "If your source is listed on that page as \"generally unreliable\" or \"deprecated\", you should not use it in your article",
    "Sources used to establish notability must additionally be independent: they must not be connected to the subject",
    "A company's own website cannot help establish notability",
    "An interview with someone cannot help establish notability, as these can be bought",
    "A press release repackaged as a news item (churnalism) cannot help either, and is sometimes more difficult to spot",
    "Articles in Forbes magazine whose author is listed as a \"Forbes contributor\" are the equivalent of an opinion column, usually paid for by a business or individual with the intent of self-promotion",
    "Sources used to establish notability must additionally demonstrate significant coverage: they must discuss your subject for awhile, at least multiple paragraphs",
    "A mention in one or two sentences, or the appearance of your subject in a table or list is not enough to help establish notability",
    "Sources that are not independent of the subject or do not demonstrate significant coverage can still be used in your article to support factual claims, but do not count towards notability",

    "VaticidalprophetDrThneed (talkReply[reply]I understand the eagerness to do the multihook, but the way I see it, there are a few issues with the multihook, some brought up by me and others by Vaticidalprophet:According to the DYK criteria, hooks need to be perceived as unusual or interesting to people without special knowledge",
    "That means, a hook should encourage readers to read more about a subject: that's why they're called hooks",
    "The currently written hook, assuming it was just a single article hook that said \"Did you know that [person] was elected to the New Zealand Parliament",
    "\", isn't really going to fly by DYK standards",
    "About a year or two ago, there was an RfC regarding the interest criterion for DYK",
    "The result was a tightening of the rules, so unlike before where hooks had to be \"interesting to a broad audience\", a criterion that almost no one could agree on its meaning, now hooks need to basically appeal to people without specialist knowledge",
    "A hook including so many bolded links might technically be considered interesting to many, but it arguably violates the spirit of the criterion, which was intended to make sure that hooks about subjects highlight something about them that would interest even non-specialists",
    "There's a concern that having so many names in a hook might backfire in terms of readership",
    "That is, there are so many names involved that readers may be impressed but less willing to actually look up every name in the hook",
    "Sure, that doesn't mean they need to read everything, but that's a possibility if reader resources are being spread thin",
    "Basically, the more names in the hook, the less that each individual article may actually be read by readers",
    "Some of the proposals given above are actually really good in their own right and would probably do bonkers or at least do pretty well as standalone hooks",
    "I think it would be a shame to put them to waste since I think just having a multihook where the names get a passing mention rather than their own hooks where they are a star would not give them and their careers justice",
    "As for the concern about spreading out, that shouldn't be much of an issue",
    "The hooks are already provided above, you don't have to come up with your own",
    "We're already having a biography shortage already and hooks running a month or more after approval isn't uncommon, so it's not necessarily a problem",
    "There could also perhaps be some form of compromise",
    "Perhaps only the \"best of the best\" of the MP hooks could be split off into their own hooks, while the others could be left in the multihook",
    "The tricky part is that a lot of Vaticidalprophet's proposals are actually pretty good and it would be a shame to leave any of them out",
    "I'm not entirely against multihooks in general, and I think under the right circumstances they can work, but I think the current proposal goes against the spirit of the current guidelines, particularly the ones about interest to a broad audience",
    "Narutolovehinata (talk \u00b7 contributionsReply[reply]Echoing my comments at WT:DYKWhile individual splits could be considered now, the final shape of the multi-hook can only take place once the real-life dust settles",
    "Perhaps the length of vote counting is another thing that might hook people",
    "CMD (talkReply[reply]That might make a good compromise: some of the best of the best could have their own hooks, while the rest could remain included in a multi-hook if desired",
    "It could be the best of both worlds, allowing those with very interesting stories to shine in their own right, while also avoiding the concerns about \"flooding\" DYK with New Zealand politicians by keeping some form of a multihook around and acknowledging the work and desires of those involved in wanting a multihook",
    "For example, I'm really partial to VP's proposed hooks for Davidson Rutherford, Costley, Campbell, and Wedd and think they might do well on their own, while the others have okay-to-decent hooks but may not be as big of a loss if they were grouped under a multihook",
    "Narutolovehinata (talk \u00b7 contributionsReply[reply]I agree that it could be a good compromise to pull out a few of  the more interesting ones and run the rest as a multihook, if the community is agreeable",
    "I am certainly open to rephrasing the multihook itself too, which as noted by Chipmunkdavis is likelier to be easier once the full count has been completed, and there will be new sources detailing all the new MPs and noting things like what proportion of the new parliament they make up etc",
    "suggested Davidson, Rutherford, Costley, Campbell, and Wedd as possible stand-alones",
    "My view would be that being a volunteer firefighter/umpire isn't so unusual (at least here) and also that four out of five of those are National Party MPs, so perhaps replacing Rutherford with either Scott Willis or Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke would be better",

    "I don't necessarily think the party issue is going to be a problem because what happened was proposing based on hooks rather than party, and so if one party ends up being more represented, it wasn't on purpose and was more of a side-effect of the overall effort rather than an intentional effort to promote one party over the other",
    "Narutolovehinata (talk \u00b7 contributionsReply[reply]Volunteer firefighting is just a common thing in rural communities, as without it there is no fire service",

    "But regardless, if we can build a hook for Hana around her being the youngest legal/non-lying NZ MP ever (sources permitting) that would have to be more interesting, surely",

    "Numerous private resources were utilized in the rescue efforts as well, including Australian tunnelling experts Arnold Dix and Chris Cooper",
    "Though the initial attempts at a rescue were complicated because of the kinds of debris created in the collapse, the government brought in  \"rat-hole\" miners who were able to use manual mining methods to get an access pipe to the trapped workers",
    "Background[edit]The Silkyara Bend\u2013Barkot tunnel was being constructed by Navayuga Engineering Construction Limited (NECL) under National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) as part of the Char Dham project, intended to connect important Hindu pilgrim sites in Uttarakhand with two-lane, all-weather paved roads",
    "The tunnel was located on the Yamunotri end of , which is planned to connect DharasuThe initial tender for the development project did not anticipate the complexity of building tunnels in this specific geography",
    "Because the  Himalayas are a very young mountain formation, and this particular section of the Himalayas has a mix of different rock types with different levels of strength, the construction has encountered multiple collapses and other faults",
    "Landslides have also been increasing in recent decades as construction increases, and this is expected to get more complicated as climate change increases the intensity of rain and glacial melt flooding events",
    "Collapse[edit] A team of geologists from the state government of Uttarakhand and educational institutions was sent to the location to determine the cause of the incident",
    "According to investigators, the tunnel did not have any escape shafts for evacuation in an emergency and was built in a geological fault",
    "The tunnel's location is in proximity to the main central thrust of the Himalayas which is a major geological fault and is generally accepted to be a shear zone",
    "The Border Roads Organisation said in a statement that the tunnel was being constructed in an extremely weak rock mass constituting meta-siltstone and phyllites",
    "Rescue efforts[edit]The state government launched Operation Zindagi (\"life\") to save the trapped workers",

    "On the Barkot end of the tunnel, THDC India LimitedOil and Natural Gas Corporation was preparing for vertical drilling",
    "\"rat-hole\" miners in the rescue team broke through the remaining length of debris and pushed a pipe to the trapped workers manually",
    "The rescue team evacuated the workers one-by-one on stretchers, throughout the day, in a process that was expected to take several hours",
    "IST on the same day, it was confirmed by the Government of Uttarakhand The chief minister of Uttarakhand Pushkar Singh Dhami and Minister of State of Road Transport and Highways V",
    "Singh were present at the site welcoming the rescued workers",
    "The rescued workers were reported to be in good health, and they were taken to a medical facility in Chinyalisaur for initial assessment",
    "Forty-one ambulances were arranged for the individuals",
    "AIIMS Rishikesh aboard an Indian Air Force  helicopter for further assessment",
    "Investigation[edit]The government of Uttarakhand has formed a six-member expert committee to investigate the cause of the tunnel collapse",

    "Teams of multiple riders attempt to cover a large distance in a single event",
    "Teams are given the ability to change riders during the race",
    "Endurance races can be run either to cover a set distance in laps as quickly as possible, or to cover as much distance as possible over a preset amount of time",
    "Reliability of the motorcycles used for endurance racing is paramount",
    "Sidecar racingSidecar racingMain article: Sidecar World ChampionshipSidecar racing is a category of sidecar motorcycle racing",
    "Older sidecar road racers generally resembled solo motorcycles with a platform attached; modern racing sidecars are purpose built low and long vehicles",

    "The riding style on the tarmac section is noticeably different from other forms of tarmac-based racing, with a different line into corners, sliding of the back wheel around the corner, and using the leg straight out to corner (as opposed to the noticeable touching of the bent knee to the tarmac of road racers)",
    "Enduro and cross-countryEnduroFormer World Enduro Champion Stefan MerrimanMain article: EnduroThere is a World Enduro Championship (WEC) that has events across Europe, with a few excursions to North America",

    "Such events include the Silk Way Rally, Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge, and Rallye du Maroc",
    "These events often run alongside \"car\" rallies (under the FIA)",
    "Track racingMain article: Track racingTrack racing is a form of motorcycle racing where teams or individuals race opponents around an oval track",
    "There are differing variants, with each variant racing on a different surface type",
    "Indoor short track and TT RacingTrack racing motorcyclesIndoor races consist of either: a polished concrete floor with coke syrup, or other media sprayed or mopped onto the concrete for traction for the tyres of the motorcycles, or on dirt that has been moistened and hard packed, or left loose (often called a cushion)",
    "Similar to the size of the Arenacross Arenas or sometimes smaller, these tight indoor race tracks require the riders to have accurate throttle control to negotiate them",
    "In the U",
    ", flat-track events are held on outdoor dirt ovals, ranging in length from one mile to half-mile, short-tracks and TTs",
    "All are usually held outdoors, though a few short-track events have been held in indoor stadiums",
    "A Short Track event is one involving a track of less than \u2044 mile in length, while a TT event can be of any length, but it must have at least one right turn and at least one jump to qualify",
    "In the A",
    "Grand National Championship, mile, half-mile, short-track and TT races are part of a specific discipline labelled \"Dirt track\" or sometimes \"Flat track\" (also called Flat Track)",
    "However the AMA Sanction rule books refer to this discipline as Dirt track racing",
    "Whether mile, half-mile, short-track or TT, traction is what defines a dirt track race",
    "The bikes cannot use \"knobbies\", they must use \"Class C\" tires which are similar to street tires",
    "On mile, half-mile, short-track course, the track is an oval, all turns to the left only, and only a rear brake is allowed",
    "On the TT courses, there must be at least one right hand turn with a jump being optional,  front and rear brakes are allowed, but the same \"Class C\" tires are required",
    "Although not mandated, most flat track racers wear a steel \"shoe\" on the left boot which is actually a fitted steel sole that straps onto the left boot",
    "This steel shoe lets the rider slide more easily and safely on their left foot when needed as they lean the bike to the left while sliding through the corners, though riders can often perform what is known as a \"feet-up slide\", using throttle control, body lean and steering alone to power-slide through the turns, without sliding on their steel shoe",
    "Hard-packed tracks are generally referred to as \"groove\" tracks, loosely packed tracks are called \"cushions\"",
    "The composition of the track surface is usually decided by the race promoter and track preparation team, the latter using various methods and materials including combinations of clay, decomposed granite, sand, calcium (to allow the surface to retain water moisture) and other materials",
    "An optimum \"groove\" track will have enough moisture to be \"tacky\", without being slick, and will develop what is called a \"blue groove\" as the motorcycle tires lay down a thin layer of tire rubber on the racing line",
    "A \"cushion\" track consists of similar materials to the groove track, but mixed in a way that allows the surface to maintain a more sandy, loose composition",
    "While power-sliding is common on both groove and cushion tracks, a cushion track allows more power-sliding, into, through and out of the turns",
    "Though the \"Class C\" tires allowed by the rules are the same for both cushion and groove tracks, riders are allowed to modify the tires by cutting some rubber off the tire grooves for improved traction, but are not allowed to add materials to the tires",
    "SpeedwaySpeedwayMain article: Motorcycle speedwaySpeedway racing takes place on a flat oval track usually consisting of dirt or loosely packed shale, using bikes with a single gear and no brakes",
    "Competitors use this surface to slide their machines sideways (powersliding or broadsiding) into the bends using the rear wheel to scrub-off speed while still providing the drive to power the bike forward and around the bend",
    "GrasstrackGrass track racingMain article: GrasstrackLong Track at world level), often on grass (although other surfaces exist) and even feature elevation changes",
    "Machinery is very similar to a speedway bike (still no brakes, but normally two gears, rear suspension, etc",

    "Other categoriesDrag racing/sprintsDrag RacingMain article: Motorcycle drag racingDrag racing or sprints is a racing venue where two participants line up at a dragstrip with a signaled starting line",
    "Upon the starting signal, the riders accelerate down a straight, quarter-mile long paved track where their elapsed time and terminal speed are recorded",
    "The rider to reach the finish line first is the winner",
    "This can occur upon purpose built venues (e",
    ", Santa Pod), temporary venues (e",
    ", runways or drives of country houses)",
    "In addition to \"regular\" motorcycles, top fuel motorcycles using Nitromethane also compete in this category",
    "UK Sprinting The president was Donald CampbellVincent employee and sprint-record holder George BrownACU competition licence",
    "Brown's machines included the V twin Vincent-engined, normally-aspirated , and the supercharged version",
    "Sprinting occurred on disused and re-purposed airstrips, and on a few sea-front promenades, generally with one set of timing equipment, for the \u2044-mile distance, although some used \u2044-mile, as still happens at the Ramsey seafront as the , part of added attractions during the Isle of Man TT and Manx Grand Prix events",
    "Santa Pod RacewayThough basically similar, sprinting and drag racing have essential differences",
    "Sprinting is a race against the clock, even if other competitors are taking part at the same time",
    "Drag racing is more of a contest, often between a couple of racers",
    "Where a time was one-way only, any record could be regarded as strip-only, as for official recognition of world and national records two qualifying runs had to be completed in opposite-directions within one-hour, to negate the effect of wind, with an average time resulting",
    "Motorcycle News contributor Jim Reynolds stated: \"This is drag racing, a young sport in England, but growing faster than any other\"",
    "Hill climbMain article: HillclimbingIn hill climbing, a single rider climbs or tries to climb a road going up a hill in the fastest time or the furthest up the hill before ceasing forward motion",
    "Tarmac events are typically on closed public roads and private roads",
    "The same concept is also used off-tarmac, usually on steeper hills",
    "Landspeed racingMain article: Motorcycle land speed recordIn Landspeed motorcycle racing, the racer is trying to beat the fastest speed ever achieved by that style of motorcycle and type of engine for a timed mile",
    "The pre-eminent event for motorcycle LSR is the International Motorcycle Speed Trials by BUB, held on the Bonneville Salt Flats annually (near Labor Day)",
    "Motorcycles are classified based on body style, i",
    "how much streamlining is incorporated",
    "They are further classified based on engine size in cubic centimeters (cc's) and based on fuel type (gasoline versus any modified fuels)",
    "VintageMain article: historic motorsport[citation needed]The sanctioning body for most US vintage racing is the American Motorcyclist Association",

    "int The East African Community (EAC) is an intergovernmental organisation composed of eight countries in East Africa",
    "The member states are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Federal Republic of Somalia, the republics of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda, as well as the United Republic of Tanzania",
    "Salva Kiir MayarditSouthern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the EAC agreed to an expanded free trade area including the member states of all three organizations",
    "The EAC is an integral part of the African Economic Community",
    "The EAC is a potential precursor to the establishment of the East African Federation, a proposed federation of its members into a single sovereign state",
    "for goods, labour, and capital within the region, with the goal of creating a common currency and eventually a full political federation",

    "The three member states lost over sixty years of co-operation and the benefits of economies of scale, although some Kenyan government officials celebrated the collapse with champagne",
    "Presidents Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, and Yoweri Kaguta Museveni of Uganda signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation in Kampala on  A process of re-integration was embarked on involving tripartite programmes of co-operation in political, economic, social and cultural fields, research and technology, defence, security, and legal and judicial affairs",
    "customs uniontariffs will apply to goods imported from third-party countries",
    "confederation rather than federation",
    "South Sudan's accession to the EACThe presidents of Kenya and Rwanda invited the Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan to apply for membership upon the independence of South Sudan Analysts suggested that South Sudan's early efforts to integrate infrastructure, including rail links and oil pipelines, with systems in Kenya and Uganda indicated intention on the part of Juba to pivot away from dependence on Sudan and toward the EAC",
    "Reuters considers South Sudan the likeliest candidate for EAC expansion in the short term, and an article in Tanzanian daily The Citizen that reported East African Legislative Assembly Speaker Abdirahin Haithar Abdi said South Sudan was \"free to join the EAC\" asserted that analysts believe the country will soon become a full member of the regional body",
    "Daily Nation quoted a South Sudanese MP as saying that while his government was eager to join the EAC, it would likely delay its membership over concerns that its economy was not sufficiently developed to compete with EAC member states and could become a \"dumping ground\" for Kenyan, Tanzanian, and Ugandan exports",
    "This was contradicted by President Salva Kiir, who announced South Sudan had begun the application process one month later",
    "however incidents with Ugandan boda-boda operators in South Sudan have created political tension and may delay the process",
    "ongoing internal conflict",

    "[citation needed]Politics The Common Market remains hampered by national restrictions",
    "Some have questioned the extent to which the visions of a political union are shared outside the elite and the relatively elderly, arguing that the youthful mass of the population is not well informed about the process in any of the countries",
    "Others have pointed to an enhanced sense of East African identity developing from modern communications",
    "For these, the shared vision for a politically united East Africa is commendable and a potential driver for change",
    "Thus, a high-level committee headed by Amos Wako of Kenya was commissioned to investigate the possibility of speeding integration so as to achieve political federation sooner than previously visualised",
    "Yet, there have been concerns that rapid changes would allow popular reactionary politics against the project",
    "There has been an argument, however, that there are high costs that would be required at the beginning and that fast-tracking the project would allow the benefits to be seen earlier",
    "There remained significant political differences between the states",
    "Museveni's success in obtaining his third-term amendment raised doubts in the other countries",
    "The single-party dominance in the Tanzanian and Ugandan parliaments is unattractive to Kenyans, while Kenya's ethnic-politics remains absent in Tanzania",
    "Rwanda has a distinctive political culture with a political elite committed to building a developmental state",
    "It has been argued, however, that the commonalities go far deeper",
    "Many of the national elites old enough to remember the former EAC often share memories and a sharp sense of loss at its eventual dissolution",
    "More cynically, others have argued that this historical ambition provides politicians with the ability to present themselves as statesmen and representatives of a greater regional interest",
    "Furthermore, EAC institutions bring significant new powers to dispose and depose to those who serve in them",
    "Tanzania has more land than the other founding EAC nations combined, and some Tanzanians feared landgrabs by the current residents of the other EAC member nations",
    "Other problems involve states being reluctant to relinquish involvement in other regional groups, e",
    ", Tanzania's withdrawal from COMESA but staying within the SADC bloc for the Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations with the European Union",
    "Many Tanzanians are also concerned because creating a common market means removing obstacles to the free movement of labour and capital",
    "Free movement of labour may be perceived as highly desirable in Uganda and Kenya, and have important developmental benefits in Tanzania; however, in Tanzania there is widespread resistance to the idea of ceding land rights to foreigners, including citizens of Kenya and Uganda",
    "A \"Coalition of the Willing\", made up of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, began a number of initiatives amongst themselves including joint railway and oil pipeline projects, a joint tourist visa, and a defence and security pact, to get around reluctance from other members",
    "However, even within this grouping, progress on projects has been delayed",
    "Bilateral friction between members, a lack of enthusiasm, and political instability have been the primary reasons behind the delaying and weakening of integration efforts",
    "New members are expected to adjust their laws to meet EAC requirements following their accession, but this is impeded by domestic politics",

    "Abdi from Kenya",
    "The assembly has been credited with crucial bills, particularly those regarding regional and international trade, including EAC's stand on issues such as the World Trade Organization and transport on Lake Victoria",
    "EconomicsImportance of the customs unionThe key aspects of the customs union include:a Common External Tariff (CET) on imports from third countries;duty-free trade between the member states; andcommon customs procedures",
    "However, this customs union is not yet fully implemented, because there is a significant list of exclusions to the Common External Tariff and tariff-free movement of goods and services",
    "Technical work is also needed to harmonise and modernise the customs procedures in the EAC's major ports of entry",
    "The expected revenue benefits are understood to be minimal by many analysts, based on comparative-static simulation exercises demonstrating the one-off impacts of the immediate introduction of the CU's full tariff package",
    "The findings suggest an increase in intraregional trade that is largely the result of trade diversion, not trade creation, with some aggregate welfare benefits in Kenya and Tanzania but welfare losses in Uganda",
    "From a trade-integration perspective, the EAC may not be the best chosen unit, because the current trade between the three countries is small compared to their external trade, and the EAC's  citizens do not represent a large market in global terms, given the very low average incomes",
    "Emerging business trendsBusiness leaders are far more positive than economists about the benefits of EAC integration, its customs union as a step in the process, as well as the wider integration under COMESA",
    "The larger economic players perceive long-term benefits in a progressively expanding regional market",
    "Patterns of regional development are already emerging, including:An intraregional division of labour is developing, which results in basic import-processing relocating to the coast to supply the hinterland",
    "The final stages of import-processing (especially those bulky finished goods that involve high transportation costs) and natural-resource based activities are moving up-country and up-region, either within value chains of large companies or different segments located by firms in different countries",
    "Trade in goods and services has already increased as service provision to Kenyans and Tanzanians is already important for Uganda (in education and in health)",
    "Kenya exports financial services, for example via the Kenya Commercial Bank and purchase and upgrading of local operators in Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan",
    "Uganda hopes integration will help support its tourism potential through integration with established regional circuits",
    "There are signs of a business culture oriented to making profits through economies of scale and not on protectionism",
    "Trade negotiationsMain article: Trade in the East African CommunityEconomic Partnership AgreementLeast Developed Country, stood to lose most from the failure to reach agreement",
    "Discussions are also under way between the EAC and the USA on the launch of Trade and Investment Partnership (TIP) negotiations",
    "Poverty reductionEAC that have economies have large informal sectors, unintegrated with the formal economy and large business",
    "The concerns of large-scale manufacturing and agro-processing concerns are not broadly shared by the bulk of available labour",
    "Research suggest the promised investments on the conditions of life of the region's overwhelmingly rural poor will be slight, with the significant exception of agro-industrial firms with out-grower schemes or that otherwise contribute to the co-ordination of smallholder production and trade",
    "It is informal trade across borders that is most often important to rural livelihoods and a customs union is unlikely to significantly impact the barriers that this faces and taxes are still being fixed separately by countries",
    "However, the introduction of one-stop border posts being introduced and the reduction in tariff barriers are coming down progressively",
    "The establishment of a common market will create both winners (numerous food producers and consumers on both sides of all borders) and losers (smugglers and the customs, police and local government officers who currently benefit from bribery at and around the borders) in the border areas",
    "More substantial impact could be attained by a new generation of investments in world-market production based on the region's comparative advantages in natural resources (especially mining and agriculture) and the new tariff structure creates marginally better conditions for world-market exporters, by cheapening inputs and by reducing upward pressures on the exchange rate",

    "Mwai Kibaki The protocol will leads the free movement of labour, capital, goods and services within the EAC",
    "Member states will have to change their national laws to allow the full implementation of some aspects of the Common Market such as immigration and customs",
    "This legislation may take up to five years for each of the countries to enact fully but official recognition of the common market took place on",
    "Kenya expects that its citizens will begin to enjoy freedom of movement in the EAC within two months",
    "Kenya, Rwanda and Burundi have already agreed to waive work permit fees for EAC citizens",
    "The free movement of people in the EAC is set to be improved with the introduction of \"third generation\" ID cards",
    "These cards will identify the holder as a dual citizen of their home country and of \"East Africa\"",
    "Mutual recognition and accreditation of higher education institutions is also being worked towards as is the harmonisation of social security benefits across the EAC",
    "The full adoption of the common market has been undermined by continued protectionism between member states, with decisions driven by political pressures on national leaders slowing down the implementation of commitments to integration, even within founding members",
    "Bilateral political tensions have led to border controls in some periods, further undermining the shared labour market",
    "Corruption has led to some integration initiatives being underfunded",

    "He was the first person to demonstrate that the Moon moved around the Earth in an elliptical orbit; and he was the only person to predict the , an event which he and his friend William Crabtree were the only two people to observe and record",
    "Most remarkably, Horrocks correctly asserted that Jupiter was accelerating in its orbit while Saturn was slowing and interpreted this as due to mutual gravitational interaction, thereby demonstrating that gravity's actions were not limited to the Earth, Sun, and Moon",
    "His early death and the chaos of the English Civil War nearly caused the loss to science of his treatise on the transit, Venus in sole visa; but for this and his other work he is acknowledged as one of the founding fathers of British astronomy",
    "Early life and education[edit]Jeremiah Horrocks was born at Lower Lodge Farm in Toxteth Park, a former royal deer park near Liverpool, Lancashire",
    "His father James had moved to Toxteth Park to be apprenticed to Thomas Aspinwall, a watchmaker, and subsequently married his master's daughter Mary",
    "Both families were well educated Puritans; the Horrocks sent their younger sons to the University of Cambridge and the Aspinwalls favoured Oxford",
    "Jeremiah was introduced early to astronomy; his boyhood chores included measuring the local noon used to set local clocks, and his Puritan upbringing instilled an enduring suspicion of astrology, witchcraft and magic",
    "matriculated at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge as a sizar",
    "At Cambridge he associated with the mathematician John Wallis and the platonist John Worthington",
    "At that time he was one of only a few at Cambridge to accept Copernicus's revolutionary heliocentric theory, and he studied the works of Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe and others",
    "Marston suggests that he may have needed to defer the extra cost this entailed until he was employed, whilst Aughton speculates that he may have failed his exams due to concentrating too much on his own interests, or that he did not want to take Anglican orders, and so a degree was of limited use to him",
    "Astronomical observations[edit]astrolabe and cross staff were easy to find",
    "But there was no market for the very specialised astronomical instruments he needed, so his only option was to make his own",
    "He was well placed to do this; his father and uncles were watchmakers with expertise in creating precise instruments",
    "Apparently he helped with the family business by day and, in return, the watchmakers in his family supported his vocation by assisting in the design and construction of instruments to study the stars at night",
    "Horrocks owned a three-foot radius astronomicus While a youth he read most of the astronomical treatises of his day and marked their weaknesses; by the age of seventeen he was suggesting new lines of research",
    "Tradition has it that after he left home he supported himself by holding a curacy in Much Hoole, near Preston in Lancashire, but there is little evidence for this",
    "According to local tradition in Much Hoole, he lived at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton",
    "Carr House was a substantial property owned by the Stones family who were prosperous farmers and merchants, and Horrocks was probably a tutor for the Stones' children",
    "Lunar research[edit]Horrocks was the first to demonstrate that the Moon moved in an elliptical path around the Earth, and he posited that comets followed elliptical orbits",
    "He supported his theories by analogy to the motions of a conical pendulum, noting that after a plumb bob was drawn back and released it followed an elliptical path, and that its major axis rotated in the direction of revolution as did the apsides of the Moon's orbit",
    "He anticipated Isaac Newton in suggesting the influence of the Sun as well as the Earth on the Moon's orbit",
    "In the Principia Newton acknowledged Horrocks's work in relation to his theory of lunar motion",
    "In the final months of his life Horrocks made detailed studies of tides in attempting to explain the nature of lunar causation of tidal movements",
    "Transit of Venus[edit]Main article: Johannes HeveliusThe title page of Jeremiah Horrocks' Opera Posthuma, published by the Royal SocietyJohannes Kepler had published his Rudolphine Tables and two years later he published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet  which included an admonitio ad astronomos (warning to astronomers) concerning a transit of Mercury Horrocks' own observations, combined with those of his friend and correspondent William Crabtree, had convinced him that Kepler's Rudolphine tables, although more accurate than the commonly used tables produced by Philip Van Lansberg, were still in need of some correction",
    "Kepler's tables had predicted a near-miss of a transit of VenusVenus for years, Horrocks predicted a transit would indeed occur",
    "Horrocks made a simple helioscope by focusing the image of the Sun through a telescope onto a plane surface, whereby an image of the Sun could be safely observed",
    "From his location in Much HooleJulian calendarGregorian calendarBroughton near Manchester",
    "Horrocks' observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size of Venus\u2014previously thought to be larger and closer to Earth\u2014and to estimate the distance between the Earth and the Sun, now known as the astronomical unit (AU)A treatise by Horrocks on the study of the transit, Venus in sole visa (Venus seen on the Sun), was later published by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius at his own expense; it caused great excitement when revealed to members of the Royal Society\"",
    "Thy returnPosterity shall witness; years must rollAway, but then at length the splendid sightAgain shall greet our distant children's eyes",
    "\"It was a time of great uncertainty in astronomy, when the world's astronomers could not agree amongst themselves and theologians fulminated against claims that contradicted Scripture",
    "Horrocks, although a pious young man, came down firmly on the side of scientific determinism",
    "It is wrong to hold the most noble Science of the Stars guilty of uncertainty on account of some people's uncertain observations",
    "Through no fault of its own it suffers these complaints which arise from the uncertainty and error not of the celestial motions but of human observations",
    "I do not consider that any imperfections in the motions of the stars have so far been detected, nor do I believe that they are ever to be found",
    "Far be it from me to allow that God has created the heavenly bodies more imperfectly than man has observed them",
    "\u2013 Jeremiah HorrocksDeath[edit] He has been described as a bridge which connected Newton with Copernicus, Galileo, Brahe and Kepler",
    "It is believed that Horrocks was buried at Toxteth Unitarian Chapel, but there is seemingly no proof of this",
    "Legacy[edit]Jeremiah Horrocks Observatory on Moor Park, PrestonSculpture commemorating Horrocks at the Pier Head, LiverpoolHorrocks is remembered on a plaque in Westminster Abbey and the lunar crater Horrocks Toxteth Unitarian Chapel contains a memorial plaque commemorating his achievements",
    "Horrocks Avenue in Garston, Liverpool, is also named after him",
    "Moor Park, Preston",
    "Horrocks and the transit of Venus feature in an episode (\"Dark Matter\") of the British television series Lewis",
    "Heaven and Earth, was installed at Dock Head in Liverpool to celebrate Horrock's work on the transit of Venus",
    "It consists of a telescope looking at a working orrery which has the planet Venus replaced by a figure of the astronomer depicted as an angel",

    "The friends, followers of the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, were self-taught  who had worked methodically to correct and improve Kepler's Rudolphine tablesSolar System; for this and their other achievements Horrocks and Crabtree, along with their correspondent William Gascoigne, are considered to be the founding fathers of British research astronomy",

    "Two years later he published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet  which included an admonitio ad astronomos (warning to astronomers) concerning a transit of MercuryJohann Baptist Cysat in Innsbruck, Johannes Remus Quietanus in Rouffach and Pierre Gassendi in Paris, vindicating the Keplerian approach",
    "But their observations threw into question previous theories about the Solar System, as Mercury was shown to be much smaller than expected",
    "Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit",
    "According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean should have been able to view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded",
    "Jeremiah Horrocks[edit]Main article: Jeremiah Horrocks was born in Lower Lodge, Toxteth Park \u2013 now part of Liverpool but at that time a separate town",
    "His father James was a watchmaker, and his mother Mary Aspinwall was from a notable Toxteth Park family",
    "Several members of the Aspinwall family were also in the watchmaking trade, and it is said that a watchmaker uncle first interested Jeremiah in astronomy",
    "Jeremiah joined Emmanuel Collegematriculated as a member of the University of Cambridgesizar, which meant he did not have the means to fully support himself and was given specific duties to compensate for a reduction in fees",
    "At Cambridge, he would have studied the arts, classical languages, a little geometry, and some traditional astronomy, but not the latest work by Galileo, Tycho Brahe and Kepler",
    "He used his spare time to teach himself the more demanding mathematical astronomy and familiarise himself with the latest thinking",
    "graduating, presumably owing to the cost of the graduation ceremony",
    "After leaving Cambridge, Horrocks returned to his home in Lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest, the study of astronomy",
    "Much Hoole",
    "This was probably to become tutor to the children of the Stones family, prosperous haberdashers who lived at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton",
    "Horrocks was the first to demonstrate that the Moon moved in an elliptical path around the Earth",
    "He also wrote a treatise on Keplerian astronomy and began to explore mathematically the properties of the force that became known as gravity",
    "Decades later, Isaac Newton acknowledged Horrocks's work in relation to the Moon in Newton's Principia",

    "Crabtree's observations had convinced him that, despite their errors, Kepler's Rudolphine Tables were superior to the commonly used Lansberg's tablesTransit of Mercury[edit]Old Style) which Kepler had not predicted",
    "He explained that he intended to construct what would later be called a helioscope by attaching his telescope to an \"oblong stick, carrying a plane surface at right angles to itself on which to receive the Sun's image\", and that he would draw a circle with numerical markings on a sheet of paper on which to project the image of the Sun",
    "In the event, no such transit took place as Mercury passed over the Sun well outside the limit for a transit, but the exercise proved to be an important dry-run for the later observation of the transit of Venus",
    "and realised that the second transit would occur in less than four weeks",
    "He was convinced that a measurement could be made of the apparent diameter of the planet to within a fraction of a second of arc when it was seen as a dull black disk on the face of the Sun, compared to an accuracy of around one minute of arc when seen in its normal position as the bright morning star close to the Sun",
    "To quote Horrocks: \"The more accurate calculations of Rudolphi very much confirmed my expectations; and I rejoiced exceedingly in the prospect of seeing Venus\"",

    "The image does not, however, give a true representation of what Horrocks would have seen",
    "Horrocks was concerned that the weather would be unfavourable for the transit as he believed the rare planetary conjunction would produce severe weather:The chance of a clouded atmosphere caused me much anxiety; for Jupiter and Mercury were in conjunction with the Sun almost at the same time as Venus",
    "This remarkable assemblage of the planets (as if they were desirous of beholding, in common with ourselves, the wonders of the heavens, and of adding to the splendour of the scene), seemed to forebode great severity of weather",
    "Mercury, whose conjunction with the Sun is invariably attended with storm and tempest, was especially to be feared",
    "In this apprehension I coincide with the opinion of the astrologers, because it is confirmed by experience; but in other respects I cannot help despising their more puerile vanities",
    "\u2014\u200aJeremiah Horrocks, Venus in sole visa\u2014\u200aJeremiah Horrocks, Venus in sole visa'Crabtree made his observations using a similar set-up but had insufficient time to make any measurements, as it was cloudy in Broughton, and thus he only saw the transit briefly",
    "According to Horrocks: \"Rapt in contemplation he stood for some time, scarcely trusting his own senses, through excess of joy",
    "In a little while, the clouds again obscured the face of the Sun, so that he could observe nothing more than that Venus was certainly on the disc at the time",
    "\"Results[edit] When Horrocks's measurements of Venus, coupled with some erroneous measurements by Kepler and Gassendi, seemed to confirm this, Horrocks tentativelyAstronomical Unit is known to be today, but, despite being based on a false premise, was more accurate than any suggested up to that time",
    "William Gascoigne, had developed a reticle and a micrometer for his telescope, both of which would have been invaluable to Horrocks",
    "Gascoigne showed them to Crabtree, who told Horrocks about them, and reported back to Gascoigne saying: \"My friend Mr Horrox professeth, that little Touch I gave him, hath ravished his mind quite from itself, and left him in an Exstasie between Admiration and Amazement",
    "I beseech you, Sir, slack not your Intentions for the Perfection of your begun Wonders",
    "\"Horrocks produced several drafts of a Latin treatise Venus in sole visaLegacy[edit]Some of the drafts of Venus in Sole VisaBattle of Marston Moor",

    "Huygens knew the eminent Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius, and gave him the manuscript copy; Hevelius appended the manuscript to his report on the Mercury transit, Mercurius in sole visus Gedani The publication of Venus in Sole Visa by Hevelius caused great consternation at the newly founded Royal Society when it was realised that such an elegant and important paper by an Englishman had been neglected in his own country for so long",
    "The mathematician John Wallis, who was a friend of Horrocks at Emmanuel College, and a founder member and leading light of the society, summed up the view of its members when he wrote:I cannot help being displeased, that this valuable observation, purchasable with no money, elegantly described and prepared for the press, should have laid for two-and-twenty years, and that no-one should have been found to take charge of so fair an offspring at its father's death, to bring to light a treatise of such importance to astronomy and to preserve a work for our country's credit and for the advantage of mankind",
    "The Royal Society assumed responsibility for publication of most of the remainder of Horrocks's work as Jeremiae Horroccii Opera PosthumaThe recording of the transit is seen by many as the birth of modern astronomy in Britain",

    "Oxford and Cambridge to fund the creation of a new chancel and Ford Madox Brown was commissioned to produce the murals known as The Manchester Murals for Manchester Town Hall",
    "The painting entitled  is a romanticised depiction of Crabtree's observation of the event",

    "Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing",
    "Measuring light intensity during the course of a transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets",

    "The event additionally was the first of its kind to be documented from space, photographed aboard the International Space Station by NASA astronaut Don PettitMeasurements made of the apparent diameter of Venus during the transit, and comparison with its known diameter, will give scientists an idea of how to estimate exoplanet sizes",
    "Observation made of the atmosphere of Venus simultaneously from Earth-based telescopes and from the Venus Express gives scientists a better opportunity to understand the intermediate level of Venus's atmosphere than is possible from either viewpoint alone",
    "This will provide new information about the climate of the planet",
    "Spectrographic data taken of the well-known atmosphere of Venus will be compared to studies of exoplanets whose atmospheres are thus far unknown",
    "The Hubble Space Telescope, which cannot be pointed directly at the Sun, used the Moon as a mirror to study the light that had passed through the atmosphere of Venus in order to determine its composition",
    "This will help to show whether a similar technique could be used to study exoplanets",
