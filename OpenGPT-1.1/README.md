# OpenGPT-1.1
This is a more advanced model then `OpenGPT-1.0` as it has more data and is able to generate more better and longer sentences that make sense together. This model is also trained using data from Wikipedia.

## Example Usage

Run the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenGPT-Project/OpenGPT-1
```

```
cd OpenGPT-1
```

```
cd OpenGPT-1.1
```

Then run the python script `use.py`:
```
python3 use.py
```

Once you run the script it will prompt you with:

```
You can tell me a word or a few words:
```

and from here you can type the text you want it to complete. Once you have typed in the text you want it to complete click enter. It will then prompt you with:

```
Enter the token limit:
```

The tokens are just words so each token it one word. Once you have set your token limit, click enter and then it should generate a response.
